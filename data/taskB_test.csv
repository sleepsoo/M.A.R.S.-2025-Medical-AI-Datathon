FINDINGS: 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
Comparison is made to noncontrast head CT performed at our prior showing
diffuse acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and is better characterized on separate
report.  The ventricles and sulci are slightly enlarged.

CTA HEAD:
There is a focal outpouching of the right posterior communicating artery,
measuring about 3 mm (2; 224 and 25; 1).  Additionally, there is a 1-2 mm
equivocal outpouching of the left anterior communicating artery (2; 237 and
25; 2), probably representing an infundibulum, however a small aneurysm cannot
be completely excluded, correlation with cerebral angiogram is advised.  The
dural venous sinuses are patent.

CTA NECK:
The carotidandvertebral arteries and their major branches appear normal with
no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. There is no evidence of internal carotid
stenosis by NASCET criteria.

200 mcg of fentanyl and 3 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service
time of 2 hr 2 min during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1% lidocaine
was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site
CONTRAST: 190 ml of Optiray contrast.
FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE:  34.0  min, 431 mGy

PROCEDURE:
1. Left common femoral artery access.
2. Left common femoral arteriogram.
3. Right internal iliac arteriogram.
4. Right ileolumbar arteriograms.
5. Gel-Foam embolization of the right ileolumbar arteries.

10. Gel-Foam embolization of the right L5 lumbar artery.
11. Angio-Seal closure of the left common femoral artery access.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Following a discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the
procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient
was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table.
A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol.  Both groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the left common femoral artery was
punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid femoral head. A
___ wire was advanced easily under fluoroscopy into the aorta. A small
skin incision was made over the needle and the needle was exchanged for a 5
___ sheath which was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm
flush after performing a left common femoral arteriogram. An Omni flush
catheter was advanced over the wire and the ___ wire was exchanged for a
Glidewire. The Glidewire was used to select the left external iliac artery and
the Omniflush catheter was exchanged for a pudendal catheter.

The pudendal catheter was advanced into the right internal iliac artery.  An
arteriogram was performed to delineate the anatomy and assess for
abnormalities.  A STC microcatheter was advanced over a double angled
glidewire into the right ileolumbar artery.  An arteriogram was performed,
demonstrating no active extravasation but distal vessel irregularity. 
Gel-Foam embolization was performed of the right ileolumbar artery to stasis. 
Next, the microcatheter was withdrawn into the right internal iliac artery and
advanced into an accessory ileolumbar artery.  An arteriogram was performed,
demonstrating no active extravasation but equivocal vessel irregularity. 
Gel-Foam embolization was performed of this accessory ileolumbar artery to
stasis.

The pudendal catheter was exchanged over a Glidewire for a SOS catheter.  The
SOS catheter was advanced into the aorta and used to select the L3 lumbar
artery common trunk.  An arteriogram was performed, demonstrating no
abnormality in the territory of the right L3 lumbar artery.

The SOS catheter was withdrawn into the aorta and advanced into the right L4
lumbar artery.  An arteriogram was performed, demonstrating mild distal vessel
irregularity of the right L3 lumbar artery.  A STC microcatheter was advanced
over a microwire distally into the right L3 lumbar artery.  Gel-Foam
embolization was performed of the right L3 lumbar artery to stasis.  The
microcatheter was withdrawn.

The SOS catheter was withdrawn into the aorta and advanced into the right L5
lumbar artery.  An arteriogram was performed, demonstrating minimal distal
vessel irregularity, but given likely collateral supply to the area of
concern, decision was made to perform Gel-Foam embolization.  Gel-Foam
embolization was performed of the right L5 lumbar artery initially through the
SOS catheter and then through the STC microcatheter to near stasis.  The
microcatheter and SOS catheter were withdrawn.

The sheath was then removed and an Angio-Seal closure device was deployed.
Additional manual pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.  Sterile
dressings were applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
post-procedure complications.

FINDINGS: 

1.  No active extravasation identified but mild distal vessel irregularity of
the right ileolumbar artery, accessory right ileolumbar artery, right L4
lumbar artery, and right L5 lumbar artery.

FINDINGS: 

CHEST:

HEART AND VASCULATURE:
The current study is not optimized for evaluating the pulmonary arterial
vasculature, however a occlusive filling defect is seen at the left common
basal artery which appears to extend to all 3 left basilar segments,
concerning for pulmonary embolism (series 2, image 33).  Irregular
opacification of the right medial basal segment is indeterminate for pulmonary
embolism.

The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of acute injury. No
pericardial effusion is seen.

AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: There is a dominant right chest wall mass which
extends into the axilla measuring 14.4 x 13.1 cm, with numerous additional
satellite lesions including an ulcerating, exophytic mass in the right breast
measuring 7.6 x 6.3 cm and multiple masses within the axilla, anterior chest
wall and right supraclavicular area.  The mass demonstrate internal necrosis.
No foci of air to indicate necrotizing fasciitis. There is significant
stranding along the right flank inferior to the mass to the level of the iliac
crest (Series 601, image 40), without focal fluid collection, likely a
tentative of dependent edema.
Numerous left axillary masses are demonstrated which may represent further
spread of disease versus metastatic lymphadenopathy, measuring up to 3.6 cm.
There is a 3.9 cm conglomerate of right paratracheal lymph nodes (series 2,
image 19).
A 1.2 cm nodule along the anterior right chest wall (series 2, image 39) is
present.

PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

LUNGS/AIRWAYS: The lung parenchyma is clear without masses or areas of
parenchymal opacification.  The airways are patent to the level of the
segmental bronchi bilaterally.

Intracranial AP, lateral, and three-dimensional rotational angiography of the
left internal carotid system was next performed.  The catheter was then
withdrawn from the patient along with the sheath and pressure was held at the
arteriotomy site for 15 min.

This procedure was performed by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___.  I,
Dr. ___, was present throughout the procedure, supervised or
performed all key portions of the procedure, and have interpreted the relevant
imaging findings.

FINDINGS: 

Right vertebral artery:  The distal right vertebral, right posterior inferior
cerebellar, left anterior inferior cerebellar, bilateral superior cerebellar
and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries are well visualized.  Incidental
note is made of a duplicate configuration of the right superior cerebellar
artery.  No aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or other vascular lesion is
seen.  Vessel caliber is smooth and tapering.  The venous phase is
unremarkable.

Right common carotid artery:  The external and internal carotid systems are
well visualized.  The distal internal carotid artery, right middle cerebral,
and right anterior cerebral arteries are well visualized.  The posterior
communicating artery is patent.  The anterior communicating artery is patent
with cross-filling to the left hemisphere from the right carotid system.  A
left hemispheric arteriovenous malformation is demonstrated with feeders from
the distal left anterior cerebral artery.  There is hemodynamic supplied this
lesion from the right carotid system by way of the anterior communicating
artery.  No other aneurysm or vascular malformation is demonstrated.  See left
carotid findings for further details on this vascular malformation.

Left internal carotid artery:  The mid cervical portion of the left internal
carotid artery is tortuous.  The distal left internal carotid, anterior
cerebral, and middle cerebral arteries are well visualized.  Posterior
communicating artery is patent.  The anterior cerebral artery is
pathologically enlarged.  Distal branches of this vessel supply a left
parietal arteriovenous malformation.  Distal M4 branches of the left middle
cerebral artery also contribute to this arteriovenous malformation.  The nidus
of the AVM measures 38 x 22 mm.  The venous drainage from this arteriovenous
malformation is superficial via enlarged varices draining predominantly into
the superior sagittal sinus.  No other aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation
is seen.",F,54

PROCEDURE
1. Right internal jugular approach chest single lumen Port-a-cath placement

PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed
supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___
protocol. The upper chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein
was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent
ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which
confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right
atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a
micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short ___ wire was
advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The ___ wire
was then passed distally into the IVC.
Next, attention was turned towards creation of a subcutaneous pocket over the
upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local
anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a 2.5 cm transverse
incision was made and a subcutaneous pocket was created by using blunt
dissection. The single lumen port was then connected to the catheter.  The
catheter was tunneled from the subcutaneous pocket towards the venotomy site
from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The port was then
connected to the catheter and checks were made for any leakage by accessing
the diaphragm using a non-coring ___ needle. No leaks were found.

The port was then placed in the subcutaneous pocket and secured with ___
prolene sutures on either side. The venotomy tract was dilated using the
introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away
sheath was placed over the ___ wire through which the port was threaded into
the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium.  The sheath was
then peeled away.

The subcutaneous pocket was closed in layers with ___ interrupted and ___
subcuticular continuous Vicryl sutures.  Steri-strips were used to close the
venotomy incision site. Steri-Strips were applied over the sutures. Final spot
fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no
kinking. The tip is in the right atrium.

The port was accessed using a non coring ___ needle and could be aspirated
and flushed easily. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the
procedure well without immediate complication.  The port was left accessed as
requested.

FINDINGS: 

Patent right internal jugular vein.  Given the apparent medial course of the
microwire during initial access and inability to pass the ___ wire into the
IVC, a venogram was performed to confirm venous access.  This revealed
opacification of the superior vena cava, right atrium, and subsequently
