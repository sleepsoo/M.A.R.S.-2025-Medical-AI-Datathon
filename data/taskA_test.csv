History of Present Illness:
___ with a history of sinus bradycardia presents after having a 
fall at home. The morning of presentation around 1:40AM, the 
patient was going to the bathroom. While turning to leave the 
bathroom, he suddenly fell. The details of what happened are 
unclear as the patient gives a slightly different version than 
what his family reports.  
Per the patient, he was not sure if he was feeling lightheaded 
or dizzy prior to the fall. He says that in the process of 
turning to leave, he just suddenly fell, and he was able to get 
up off the ground afterwards with no specific symptoms.
However, per the patient's daughter, who lives with him, she 
heard a loud thump sound and woke up. She found her father on 
the ground, halfway in the bathroom and halfway out. She 
believes he had hit his head. He appeared confused and very weak 
at that time. He needed assistance to get up off the ground and 
was able to finally walk over to the bedroom after some time. 
There, he subsequently had 3 (he reports 2) episodes of 
vomiting.  
Because of the fall, he went to see his PCP, who performed an 
EKG in the office that showed atrial fibrillation with slow 
ventricular rate, and subsequently sent him into the ED for EP 
evaluation.  
 
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.1 88 134/70 20 99% RA.  
Exam notable for ""CTAB, irregularly irregular tachycardia, 
abdomen soft and NT, neuro non-focal, gait normal, atraumatic.""  

EKG read as ""102, A-Fib, Left axis, prolonged QTC 462.""  
Patient received: IVF NS 1000 mL.  
Vitals prior to transfer were: 97.7 85 121/67 15 98% RA.  
 
On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling fine with no 
specific symptoms. He says he exercises quite frequently, about 
5 times a week at the gym and runs about 1 hour each time. He 
does not get short of breath or symptomatic during exercise.  
In further discussion with the patient's daughter, she says the 
patient is quite stoic and tries to downplay his symptoms. For 
example, a year ago, he had a fall after working outside and 
tried to hide the fact and the resulting bruising.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
No fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight changes. No changes 
in vision or hearing, no changes in balance. No cough, no 
shortness of breath, no dyspnea on exertion. No chest pain or 
palpitations. No nausea or vomiting. No diarrhea or 
constipation. No dysuria or hematuria. No hematochezia, no 
melena. No numbness or weakness, no focal deficits.

History of Present Illness:
___ with obesity, sleep apnea and prior tobacco use who now
presents with chest & radiating L arm discomfort x1 day, in the
setting of an abnormal stress test and DOE for the past month. 

She says that at her prior baseline she could walk 3 miles per
day without difficulty, but that for the past month or so she
gets very winded even with walking down a hallway and has to 
take
a break. In this context she was referred to a cardiologist, who
had her undergo an exercise EKG about a week ago which was
notable for inducible ischemic changes in an inferior
distribution (just SOB but no chest/arm discomfort during the
stress test). She had PFTs at the time which were normal. 
___
she underwent a repeat exercise stress test, this time with EKG
and TTE. The EKG showed similar inferior wall ischemic changes,
she became dyspneic but not with chest/arm discomfort, and TTE
did not show any definitive inducible wall motion abnormalities
but image quality was poor such that inferior wall was not well
visualized. 

She went home after the stress echo and later that evening, at
rest/out of the blue, she began experiencing a mid-sternal 
""chest
tightness"" with pain radiating to the left upper arm. Not
accompanied by SOB. Lasted for hours on end, nothing seemed to
make it better or worse, and she did not sleep well as a result.
She came to the ED around mid-day, and ___ when she was 
given
ASA and nitroglycerin in the afternoon, she reports that both
meds helped (they were given at different times) in reducing her
pain, which at this point is all but gone entirely. ROS positive
for feeling sweaty along with the chest discomfort, but without
nausea.

___ society guidelines for  low risk patients, follow-up 
at 12 months and if no change, no further imaging needed. For 
high risk patients, initial follow-up CT at ___ months and then 
at ___ months if no change. 

CT head without contrast (___): 1. Small left parietal soft 
tissue hematoma, with no evidence of underlying fracture. 2. No 
acute intracranial process.  Specifically, no intracranial 
hemorrhage or 
acute fracture. 3. Oropharyngeal secretions. 

CTA chest (___): 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic 
abnormality. 2. Bilateral subsegmental dependent atelectasis 
with associated ground-glass opacity, which may reflect a 
superimposed infectious process/aspiration. 3. Mild central 
lymphadenopathy is likely reactive. 4. Scattered pulmonary 
nodules measuring up to 7 mm. 
This preliminary report was reviewed with Dr. ___, 
___ radiologist. RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest CT in 
___ months. 

MR cardiac (___): Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size 
with
mild global systolic dysfunction. No late gadolinium enhancement
c/w absence of focal fibrosis/scar. Increased T2 signal, 
consistent
with inflammation/edema. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
and
systolic function with no CMR evidence of ARVC. Normal coronary
artery origins. In the correct clinical context, increased T2
signal can be consistent with myocarditis.

CXR (___): Comparison to ___.  The patient has 
received a sink lead pacemaker implanted in the left pectoral 
region.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other 
complication.  The previously placed nasogastric tube and 
endotracheal tube were removed.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural 
effusions. 

EP procedure (___): 
___ w out of hospital VF arrest resuscitated in the field 
referred for EPS/RV map/procainamide challenge due to concern 
for channelopathy.
Bilateral venous access obtained. Quadripolar catheters placed 
in the RV base, HBE, HRA, decapolar catheter placed in CS. EPS 
with dual AV nodal pathways. No inducible ventricular 
arrhythmias with up to triple ventricular extrastimuli at PCL of 
600 and 400 msec, down to ___ msec. No inducible 
ventricular arrhythmias with long-short-sequence. Non-sustained 
polymorphic VT up to 4 beats after procainamide infusion. RV 
electroanatomical mapping showed predominantly normal RV voltage 
except for a very small area in the anteroseptal base of the 
RVOT. Activation showed delayed activation at this region, ___ 
msec after QRS onset. QRS after procedure RBBB after endocardial 
mapping. IV procainamide infusion performed for evaluation of 
brugada syndrome, showing QRS prolongation without eliciting BrS 
type I pattern, thus non-diagnostic.
After discussing risks and benefits, and given recent VF arrest, 
the patient was prepped for single chamber ICD implantation. The 
L deltopectoral groove was accessed and the L cephalic vein 
identified and
cannulated. A 64 cm Endotak single-coil defibrillator lead was 
advanced to the RV septal apex. Pacing and sensing parameters 
were adequate. The lead was fixed and a final pacing and sensing 
parameters were adequate and stable. A pocket was made using 
electrocautery and copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution. 
A single chamber ICD pulse genreator was placed in the pocket 
and the incision was closed with vicryl suture in three
different layers.","Transfer, s/p cardiac arrest",1.0,,,,,,,,31046492,transfer,Medicine/Cardiology,2160-12-23 18:46:05,2160-12-27 14:08:10

MR ___ SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 2:39 AM 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post right L4-L5 hemilaminectomy and discectomy with 
interval 
progression of a central and right paracentral disc extrusion, 
which may 
represent residual or recurrent disc herniation. 
2. New heterogeneous T2 signal abnormality within the right 
L4-L5 lateral 
recess at the surgical site, which may represent granulation 
tissue but 
difficult to assess further due to lack of contrast 
administration.  There is resultant severe narrowing of the 
subarticular recess with displacement of the right traversing L5 
nerve root. 
3. New focal fluid collection within the posterior soft tissues 
adjacent to the surgical site at L4-L5, measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 
3.9 cm.  Given the lack of contrast administration, possibility 
of an abscess is not excluded.  There is edematous appearance of 
the adjacent right paraspinal muscles, which may represent 
postoperative inflammation; possibility of phlegmon is not 
excluded.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a lovely ___ woman with a past medical
history of ___ disease, HTN, HLD, and hypothyroidism who
presents from the ___ for evaluation of acute on
chronic back pain. 

The patient has known osteoporosis and was diagnosed with a T12 
compression fracture in the ___ at ___, which has been 
managed medically.  Before that she also sustained a left 
clavicle fracture. She takes tramadol and APAP at home for her 
pain. Over the last ___ days she has had significant worsening 
of her back pain, causing her to require a wheelchair, whereas 
she can usually walk with a walker. She has had no falls or 
trauma. She has been unable to sleep the past few days. She 
describes the pain as constant and located in her lower back on 
either of her vertebral column. She denies radicular symptoms, 
incontinence, lack of sensation. She also denies fever or 
chills, cough, or
sick contacts. No major changes in mood or cognitive status over 
the past month.

Per discussion with family, the patient has also experienced 
worsening ___ edema over the past month, though they note that it 
started back in ___. They attributed the swelling to not 
walking as much at the ___. However, she has gained 
about 20 pounds over the past 6 months (up to 130 lbs). They 
also note that she has had decreased appetite over the past 
month.
Lastly, she experienced shortness of breath for the first time 
on ___. EMS noted pt to be hypoxic to the high ___, and 
she was placed on 4L via NC with improvement on O2 sat. 

She saw her PCP, ___ 1 week ago for similar low 
back pain. She had no red flag symptoms at that time either.  
There was no concern for new compression fracture, given lack of 
vertebral tenderness.  She was referred to the pain ___ 
evaluation and possible injections (has not yet been able to 
make an appointment). Dr. ___ noted the patient's 
worsening lower extremity edema and weight gain over past 
several months.
She prescribed the patient low dose Lasix, with plans for follow
up and ECHO if symptoms did not improve. 

Goals of care were discussed with the patient's daughter and 
son;
they confirmed that their mother is DNR/DNI, and said that they
would be ok with tests/procedures that would improve their
mother's quality of life/comfort, but would not want invasive
procedures or surgeries.

atrial pressure is >15mmHg. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is
SEVERE regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
akinesis of the inferior/inferolateral and basal
inferoseptal segments (see schematic) and mild hypokinesis of 
the remaining segments. There is beat-to-beat
variability in the left ventricular contractility due to the 
irregular rhythm. The visually estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 20%. Due to severity of mitral 
regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may
be lower. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic sinus diameter is 
normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending
aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral leaflets appear structurally normal with no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate to severe [3+] mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets
appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, most c/w prior inferoposterior
MI with subsequent adverse remodeling. MIld right ventricular 
systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe
functional mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Thoracic spine X-ray ___ 
AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine provided.  As seen on 
yesterday's 
lumbar spinal radiograph, there is a compression fracture at T12 
resulting in 
a mild acute kyphotic angulation at this level though without 
associated 
alignment abnormality or significant bony retropulsion.  There 
is no 
additional compression fracture visualized.  There does appear 
to be normal 
alignment through the cervicothoracic junction.  Minimal 
endplate spurring is 
noted in the upper to mid T-spine. 

Lumbo-sacral spine x-ray ___ 
Severe compression (vertebra plana) of the T12 vertebral body 
corresponding to 
given history.  No lumbar vertebral body height loss or 
alignment abnormality. 
Diffuse osteopenia. 

Upper extremity US ___ 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity.

CXR ___
AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  
Cardiomegaly is moderate. 
There is pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary 
edema.  Pleural 
effusions are small bilaterally.  Basal compressive atelectasis 
is suspected.  
No pneumothorax.  Aortic calcifications are noted.  Bony 
structures appear 
grossly intact.

clinic when facial droop was noted on routine cataract exam. Of
note, her eyes were dilated for exam, and then was sent to ___
ER after finding of left side weakness/facial asymmetry.

She reports head strike 1 month ago after being elbowed in face
at work and she struck a pole resulting in large right subgaleal
hematoma. She has had persistent right side headache since this,
and takes excederin TID. No nausea, but vomit x1 and decreased 
PO
intake with preference to soft foods for mild dysphagia x 2 
weeks. She also fell last night and this morning x2 without head 
strike, due to imbalance. 

On arrival to ED, left pupil was fixed and dilated, and right 
was
reactive. Code Stroke was called and CT showed large right
temporal iso-dense lesion with surrounding edema. Neurosurgery
was consulted for further evaluation. On further review, pupils 
were dilated at ophthalmology appointment and were reactive 
after several hours.

================
___ ___:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 

TTE ___
CONCLUSION: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There are no late bubbles in the left heart c/w 
absence of an intrapulmonary shunt. There is no evidence for an 
atrial septal defect or right-to-left shunt on color Doppler or 
agitated saline at rest. The right atrial pressure could not be 
estimated. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with 
a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left ventricular 
systolic function. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 73%. Left ventricular cardiac index is 
normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. 
Moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with mild global 
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal interventricular septal 
motion c/w right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. There is no evidence for an 
aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. There is 
significant pulmonic regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is SEVERE pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. The end-diastolic PR velocity is elevated 
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary right 
to left shunt at rest. Severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension (severe pulmonary vascular resistance elevation) 
with evidence of pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. 
Moderate right ventricular dilation with mild right ventricular 
systolic dysfunction. Normal left ventricular regional/global 
systolic function.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ the 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher. Other 
findings are similar.

RUQ U/S ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Indeterminate lesion in the right lobe of the liver measuring 
1.7 cm.  
Other lesions could be present as the background architecture is 
diffusely 
coarse and heterogeneous.  An MRI with contrast is recommended 
for further 
evaluation. 
2. Splenomegaly and numerous midline varices consistent with 
portal 
hypertension. 
3. Trace ascites. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  MRI with contrast recommended for further 
evaluation of indeterminate right hepatic liver lesion. 

CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.  
Dilated main 
pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary hypertension. 
2. Small right pneumothorax status post thoracentesis. 
3. Minimal amount of right pleural fluid.  Right-sided pigtail 
catheter seen in the posterior very lower right chest. 
4. Bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities, particularly in 
the upper 
lungs, may relate to pulmonary edema, in conjunction with 
expiratory phase of scan.  More focal opacity in the posterior 
left upper lobe is nonspecific, could relate to asymmetric 
pulmonary edema in conjunction with atelectasis, but infection 
not excluded. 
5. Partially imaged changes of hepatic cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension, as above.","Abnormal labs, Altered mental status, Transfer",2.0,95.0,98.0,14.0,78.0,114.0,97.5,Critical,30567276,transfer,Trauma SICU (TSICU),2158-03-28 09:51:20,2158-03-29 18:18:36

History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ female with past medical history 
significant for Crohn's disease, previously followed at ___ by 
Dr. ___ last seen in ___. Per prior notes, she was 
unresponsive to first line agents, including 5ASA and steroids, 
and not tried on immunomodulators or TNF inhibitors. She was 
last seen at ___ in ___ for follow-up after an admission to 
___ for severe colitis. There was some concern 
at that time for a rectal-vaginal fistula as well, which was 
ruled out by MRE, and there was also discussion of referral to 
Colorectal surgery, but she was then lost to follow-up.

Since that time she has been mostly seeing naturalists and 
homeopathic doctors, who have treated her for ""Lyme disease,"" 
and various intestinal ""parasites,"" most recently she has been 
taking wormwood, prescribed by her kinesiologist for recurrent 
""parasites."" She report mild abdominal complaints over the 
years, but nothing that clearly reminds her of her prior Crohn's 
disease, or has prompted her to seek medical attention. 

She now present with acute onset abdominal cramping that started 
on ___ night. This continued through ___ morning, and 
was associated with some nausea and vomiting, and notably, a 
lack of any bowel movements. The symptoms worsened through the 
day until she presented to ___ ED for evaluation. She was 
afebrile with normal vital signs, labs notable for WBC 10.5 with 
85% neutrophils, Hgb of 15.8, CRP 35.6, UCG negative, and CT 
abdomen with ""Active Crohn's flare with multiple skip lesions 
resulting in small bowel obstruction; Small volume ascites; and 
1.8 cm right adnexal cyst is likely physiologic. 

While in the ED awaiting a floor bed, she started to have bowel 
movements, the first was watery, the next two more formed, 
without blood, pain, or tenesmus. 

The patient denies fever, chills, oral or genital ulcers, 
arthritis or arthralgia. She does report a spotty, itchy rash on 
her posterior neck and right arm.

PERTINENT IMAGING

___ TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Diastolic function could not be 
assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a very small pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild 
mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP and moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Very small pericardial effusion.  

___
CXR:
1. Opacity projecting over the lower spine on lateral view could 
represent 
pleural fusion, however opacity/pneumonia could have a similar 
appearance. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Coarsened interstitial markings may be related age however 
mild pulmonary edema could have a similar appearance.

Pertinent Results:
___ CT c-spine without contrast:
1. 3 part ___ fracture of C1.  Type II dens fracture 
of C2.  8 mm of leftward displacement of the lateral mass of C1 
with respect to C2. 
2. No evidence of bony encroachment on the spinal canal.  Small 
amount of 
surrounding prevertebral soft tissue fluid.  There is small 
amount of epidural hyperdensity at the C2 level, raising concern 
for a small hematoma associated with the dens fracture although 
degenerative changes may also have this appearance. 
3. Intact C1 and C2 transverse foramina. 
4. Moderate-to-severe cervical spine degenerative change, with 
severe left 
C3-4 neural foraminal narrowing. 

___ MRI c-spine without contrast:
1. Re-identified are comminuted C1 burst fracture and AP 2 dens 
fracture with posterior angulation of the dens fragment. 
2. Prominent degenerative pannus at the C1-C2 articulation as 
well as a trace epidural likely hematoma results in severe 
spinal canal narrowing without flattening of the cord.  There is 
no cord signal change.  There is no diffusion-weighted cord 
signal abnormality. 
3. There is attenuation of the anterior longitudinal ligament at 
C3-C4 without evidence of frank disruption.  The C1-C2 
ligamentum flavum appear disrupted bilaterally. 
4. There is a small prevertebral hematoma measuring 3 mm thick 
extending from the nasopharynx to the C6 level.  Cervical 
paraspinal muscles STIR 
hyperintense signal as well as hyperintense signal of the 
atlantooccipital 
membrane is compatible with a combination of ligamentous and

FINDINGS:  
  
A right frontal approach ventriculoperitoneal shunt is 
re-demonstrated 
terminated region of the foramen of ___.  Metallic artifact 
from the shunt limits evaluation of the right frontoparietal 
region.  The overall ventricular size is smaller compared to the 
most recent CT, with minimal residual transependymal migration 
of CSF. 
  
A similar appearing intrinsically T1 hyperintense mass with a 
cystic component is seen in the region of the pineal gland with 
heterogeneous enhancement and peripheral hemosiderin deposition. 
 The mass measures 2.4 x 1.8 x 2.3 cm, unchanged from the prior 
MRI.  There is unchanged mass effect on the left midbrain and 
thalamus. 
  
An unchanged subdural collection is seen over the left frontal 
and parafalcine regions, measuring up to 2 mm maximal width.  
There is no evidence of infarction. 
  
A small developmental venous anomaly is seen in the left 
cerebellum. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Unchanged mass in the pineal region, with mass effect on the 
left midbrain and thalamus. 
2. Slightly smaller overall ventricular size compared to the

frequent ventricular ectopy. TTE demonstrated regional wall
motion abnormalities, but coronary angiogram demonstrated no
significant epicardial CAD.

He underwent PVI at ___ in ___ and redo in ___, also with a
PVC ablation at the same time, and with ___ MMVTs ablated. The ICD
was placed at that time, He has had multiple subsequent
episodes of VT requiring therapy and failed sotalol in the past.

NSVT.
In addition, he had a His bundle lead placed. Also, he had an RV
ICD lead which fractured and then was extracted and replaced in
___.

In the recent past, the patient struggles with progressive
fatigue and exertional dyspnea. His most recent DCCV for afib in
___ helped a bit. Adjustments in his diuretic and
anti-hypertensive regimen have been ongoing. At this most recent
visit, he was to start cardiac rehab, of which he has gone to 4
sessions. He is feeling ""great"" about the rehab and the progress

History of Present Illness:
___ is an ___ female with hx breast 
cancer and CLL who presents from an OSH with a large left SDH. 
Per patient, she tripped and fell 6 weeks ago on a curb. She 
reports that she bumped her cheek on the curb, but otherwise 
caught herself on hands/knees. She denies any loss of 
consciousness. She did not have any headache at that time or any 
neurologic symptoms. She was seen at an OSH after the fall for a 
laceration on her leg. She had a CT head at that time, which she 
reports was negative. She denies any other trauma since.

She does endorse that over the last 10 days she has been feeling 
more fatigued, had headaches, and some mild word finding 
difficulty. She had attributed these to stress or allergies up 
until today. She reports that today she was at the bank when she 
had a sudden onset of word finding difficulty, slurred speech,
and unsteady gait. She went home and took her blood pressure, 
which was 188/107. She then presented to an OSH where reportedly 
CT head showed a left mixed density SDH measuring 1.9 cm with 
3mm of midline shift. She was subsequently transferred to ___ 
ED and neurosurgery was consulted. OSH images were not sent with 
the patient, so CT head was repeated in the emergency room and 
showed a large left acute on chronic SDH with ~5mm of midline 
shift.

Also of note, patient has recently had difficulty swallowing 
requiring the Heimlich maneuver ___ times in the last year, most 
recently in ___. She was found to have a left tongue lesion that 
was removed via laser on ___ with Dr. ___ in ENT.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with
history of HTN, thalassemia trait, obesity, migraine headaches
and urge/stress incontinence who presents with acute onset 
severe
RLQ pain radiating to right groin and right flank. 

She states she was going to the bathroom yesterday and developed
sudden onset RLQ pain which was severe and unremitting and
radiated to the back. This was not associated with any new
urinary symptoms except for worse pain when her bladder is full.
She also denies recent f/c, changes in BMs, straining or N/V. 
She
has a history of stress and urge incontinence fro which she was
followed by urology and even tells me she was advised surgical
intervention for a rotated bladder with incomplete emptying but
she has declined this. The pain that started yesterday is very
new for her and unlike anything she's experienced before. Since
onset it has been unremitting and even progressively worsening.
Food does not make the pain any better or worse, but she
experiences worsening pain with any movement. She initially
presented to urgent care where workup included CT A/P without
contrast (contrast allergy) which was unrevealing except for
punctate right nonobstructing kidney stone of which she has a
prior history. She was otherwise afebrile, without leukocytosis
and her appendix appeared normal on CT scan. She was given a 
dose
of IV morphine but her pain continued to worsen so she was sent
to our ED for further workup and care.

left sided chest pain and was found to have a new LBBB. Her 
troponins were negative and a CTA was negative for PE and aortic 
dissection. She was given full dose ASA and SL nitro which 
eventually improved her symptoms. There was an initial plan to 
have the patient stay in the hospital for a LHC, however she 
became very anxious about this and declined the procedure. Given 
her negative troponins and improvement of symptoms, she was 
discharged home with plan for outpatient follow up.

A CXR was obtained which showed no acute process.

She received: 
___ 11:31 SL Nitroglycerin SL .4 mg 
___ 12:59 IVF  NS  125 mL/hr 
___ 12:59 IV Morphine Sulfate 2 mg 

Her ECG demonstrated a LBBB.

The patient was seen by ___ cardiology who took her to the 
cath lab due to her atypical, recurrent symptoms and new LBBB. 
The case was performed via R radial access and demonstrated a 
tight lesion in the mid RCA. LAD and LCX were normal. A bare

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ year old man who was recently 
admitted from ___ to the neurology service with acute on 
chronic back pain, urinary retention, severe bifrontal headache 
and diplopia, found to have CN III and CN IV palsy and widely 
metastatic cancer. Lumbar puncture on ___ was benign, MRI 
orbits was benign, and pain was reasonably controlled with 
opiates with the help of the pain service. He had a foley placed 
for urinary retention and was started on empiric Lupron (7.5mg 
IM ___ and daily bicalutamide for presumed prostate cancer, 
confirmed on bone biopsy from ___. Etiology of the CN III 
palsy was unclear and felt not to be leptomeningeal disease. His 
urinary retention was felt to be secondary to chronic 
arachnoiditis and scarring from his spinal stenosis and prior 
surgeries and not from the prostate cancer. He was discharged on 
dexamethasone, tizanidine, and 15 mg of oxycodone PRN for pain 
control. He has a pain contract w/ Dr ___ PCP). 

After discharge, Mr. ___ was doing reasonably well with 
pain control. However over the past three days prior to current 
admission, his back pain escalated significantly. He has new 
bilateral rib cage pain that comes and goes, worse with laying 
down. He has a new nocturnal cough present mainly when he is 
supine, productive of brown/green phlegm. Denied fevers, chills, 
chest pain or daytime coughing. He also has new bilateral lower 
extremity edema all of which occurred in the past three days. 
His pain is now also in the right hip.  He was previously 
walking independently, and is now requiring a cane secondary to 
the pain. He also had a new episode of fecal incontinence 
without sensation or awareness which is new - he has full 
control at baseline. This occured during an episode of coughing 
and inability to ambulate to the bathroom fast enough. 

On arrival to the ED, he was seen by neurology and had an MRI 
spine which they reviewed and reportedly did not show any acute 
changes from his recent MRI. He received 1 mg IV dilaudid x 7 
times between 1845 and 0034, as well as 10 mg PO valium and 1L 
NS.

orally and advanced under direct visualization until the 
tracheobronchial tree was reached.The procedure was not 
difficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The patient 
tolerated the procedure well. 
Other findings: Airways were visualized to the sub-segmental 
level bilaterally. There were no endobronchial lesions. Airways 
were patent. The mucosa was normal. There was no bleeding. There 
were a moderate amount of thick white/green secretions which 
were suctioned from the major airways and sent for culture. The 
RUL posterior segment was wedged and lavaged with return of 
turbid clear fluid. The RLL posterior segment was wedged and 
lavaged with returned of turbid light pink fluid. The total 
amount of sterile saline instilled was 150cc, and there was 
return of ~35cc. These samples were sent for analysis. No 
bleeding was noted after the procedure. The patient tolerated 
the procedure well.  

___ BRONCHIAL LAVAGE - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS

___ CT BONE BIOPSY PROCEDURE
FINDINGS: 
1. Diffuse infiltration of the lumbar spinal vertebral bodies 
better 
appreciated on recent MR.

vertebral body from a right pedicle approach. 
IMPRESSION:  
2 core biopsies of the L3 vertebral body obtained without 
immediate 
postprocedure complication. 

___ PATHOLOGY BONE
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
1. Vertebral body, L3, core needle biopsy #1: Adenocarcinoma 
consistent with prostatic origin, see note.
2. Vertebral body L3, core needle biopsy #2: Adenocarcinoma 
consistent with prostatic origin, see 
note.
Note: The tumor is morphologically similar to the patient's 
prior specimen - right iliac metastasis of prostatic 
adenocarcinoma (___). The carcinoma is positive for 
NKX3.1 and negative for CD56.

___ BILATERAL LENIS
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

___ CTA TORSO
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Near complete resolution of bilateral predominantly central 
peribronchial opacities in the right upper lobe, middle lobe, 
right lower lobe, and left lower lobe and lingula compared to ___. Interval resolution of a 10 mm pulmonary nodule in 
the right lung base.  No new pulmonary nodules. 
3. Stable 2.0 cm aortopulmonary window lymph node. 
4. New fracture of the right fourth rib associated with a 
sclerotic lesion. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease is 
re-demonstrated including fractures of the left iliac wing, left 
2, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 ribs, and right 5 and 7 ribs. 
5. Heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate gland with 
extracapsular 
extension posteriorly and enlarged left pelvic sidewall lymph 
nodes,

Chief Complaint:
palpitations, lower extremity edema
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ female with no significant past medical 
history (minimal contact with health care system) who presented 
to the ED with complaints of a cough, palpitations, and lower 
extremity edema for the 3 weeks prior to presentation. She has 
no prior history of heart failure or A. fib. She reported that 
the cough and palpitations has been constant over this period of 
time, however she thinks the leg swelling has worsened over the 
last few days which is why prompted her to present to the ED. 
She has not had any chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
exertion, PND, or orthopnea. She also denies abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, dysuria or hematuria. 


On arrival the ED, she was triggered for a heart rate in the 
160s in atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, the patients blood 
pressure and oxygen saturations were normal and she was 
mentating well. She did have complaints of palpitations and 
cough. Her exam was notable for tachycardia, an irregular heart 
rhythm, clear lungs on moderate lower extremity edema. A bedside 
ultrasound was done which showed mild bilateral pleural 
effusions and significant B-lines, however, no significant 
valvular disease. Her labs were notable for a proBNP: 2607, 
troponin of <0.01, and a normal CBC and chem-10. A CXR showed 
moderate cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema, and no definite focal 
consolidation. She was given Diltiazem 30 mg PO x1, Furosemide 
20 mg IV x1, and Diltiazem 15 mg IV x1. She was initially 
ordered for IVF, however, these were not given as she was volume 
overloaded on exam. 

On arrival to the cardiology floor, the patient is resting 
comfortably in no acute distress. She endorses the above 
history. On the floor, the patient's HRs were in the 150-170s 
sustained with a BP of 150/70s. She denies chest pain or 
shortness of breath. She continues to endorse palpitations and a 
cough which is worse with lying down. She was given 5IV 
metoprolol with improvement in her HRs to the 110s.

to 100% oxygenation.
 - Exam notable for  severe tachypnea/restaurant distress with 
speaking limited to 2 word sentences.  Patient was rapidly 
escalated on oxygen therapy to BiPAP. Lung sounds were noted to 
be diminished in the right upper, crackles heard in the left 
upper lung.
 - Labs were notable for:  Na 136, K 3.9, chloride 94, 
bicarbonate 26, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5,  calcium 9.3, magnesium 
2.2, phosphate 3.3, proBNP 4065. No CBC was obtained in 
emergency room.  Lactate was 2.2.  ___ 15.1, PTT 25.7, INR 1.4.  
Blood cultures were obtained.
 - Imaging:  Patient had an x-ray which demonstrated extensive 
bilateral pleural and pulmonary opacities concerning for 
metastatic disease with areas of fibrosis.  No available prior 
imaging was available for initial comparison the emergency room. 
 patient was reportedly unable to lie flat for a CT scan.  There 
is no pericardial tamponade noted on POCUS
-  an EKG was obtained that demonstrated narrow complex 
tachycardia with questionable consistency with multifocal atrial 
tachycardia, frequent PVCs.
 - Patient was given:    Foley catheter, Patient was given IV 
vancomycin 1000 mg followed by an additional 500 mg   vancomycin

ED course was notable for a trigger for elevated heart rates of 
115, dyspnea, tachypnea to rest her rate of ___.  Later on, 
patient had a short run of ventricular tachycardia, with patient 
asymptomatic at the time. 
  
During triage it became clear patient was a long-standing 
patient at ___.  Complete medical 
records were not available at the time of initial evaluation, 
and after receiving signout form emergency department emergency 
fax was sent to medical records at ___ for further information 
regarding his oncologic and other history. Given the rapid 
progression of his oxygen requirement and the likely 
anticipation of intubation to maintain his respiration, 
conversation regarding goals of care was brought up in the 
emergency room.  It became clear that patient had not yet had 
this issue addressed.  the patient was advised that should he be 
intubated it would not be clear that he would ever have an 
opportunity to proceed with extubation.  He expressed interest 
in the emergency department of deferring the decision until 
having the opportunity to discuss the matter with his daughter. 

On arrival to the MICU, the patient continues to be tachypneic 
to the ___ to ___ but is awake and oriented. An extensive goals 
of care discussion was held with several family members 
including his son and daughters. Result of the discussion was: 
code status of DNR/DNI, continue treating for reversible causes 
like pulm edema / pneumonia, however would re-initiate 
discussion for intubation if clinical status worsens.

IMAGING
=======
___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Extensive bilateral pleural and pulmonary opacities concerning 
for metastatic disease with areas of fibrosis.  Please correlate 
clinically, CT recommended in the absence of prior imaging to 
further assess. 

___ Imaging BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

___ Imaging CTA CHEST  
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 
2. Innumerable soft tissue masses involving the mediastinum, 
left pleura, left ribs, and left abdominal wall.  These masses 
are amenable to image guided biopsy. 
3. A mass anterior to the heart demonstrates effacement of the 
pericardial 
fat.  A left abdominal wall mass indents the spleen, without 
intervening fat plane.  These could suggest tumor involvement of 
these organs. 
4. Possible thickening of the right colon just posterior to 
segment 6 of the liver, likely along the hepatic flexure.  This 
is incompletely evaluated. 

___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
anterior, lateral, and inferolateral walls, sparing the true 
apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with 
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. At least moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
which may be c/w CAD; suggestion of elevated LV filling 
pressure. Mild aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Mildly dilated 
thoracic aorta. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.  

___ Imaging RENAL U.S.  
No evidence of hydronephrosis. A 1.8 cm cortical simple cyst is 
seen within the interpolar region of the left kidney.  
A punctate echogenic focus within the interpolar region of the 
right kidney likely represents a calyceal diverticulum with 
crystals. 

___ CT Chest
1. There is new large area ground-glass opacity in the right 
middle ___ be inflammatory or infectious. 
2. Stable extensive mesothelioma. 
3. Stable 26 left upper paratracheal node.  Minimal decrease in 
size of a 
currently 29 x 11 mm pericardial node. 
4. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, 
ground-glass opacities, few areas of honeycombing, suggestive of 
usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). 
5. Indeterminate 1.5 cm nodule right lung apex, continued 
follow-up 
recommended to exclude neoplasm.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, 
benefits and 
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was 
obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the 
recovery suite of the 
Interventional Radiology department and placed supine on a 
stretcher.  A 
pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol. 
  
US assessment of the right groin was then performed both in B 
mode and color Doppler showing complete thrombosis of the 
previously seen pseudoaneurysm in the right groin.  The neck was 
no longer visualized.  Hence, given spontaneous thrombosis, no 
intervention was pursued. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Complete thrombosis of the previously seen pseudoaneurysm in the 
right groin. No intervention pursued. 

___ ECHO:
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with CAD in the mid LAD distribution (see diagram for details). 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

Chief Complaint:
falls, loss of consciousness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a history of IVDU, last used heroin
yesterday who presents after 2 episodes of ?syncope and 
?seizure.
She was standing outside her shelter yesterday evening having a
cigarette with her husband when she felt her legs ""give out"". No
warning signs prior to the fall. She did not lose consciousness
and does have memory of the event. Landed on her back but did 
not
hit her head. No neck pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or
lightheadedness. After she fell 2 times she was brought to ED in
___ where she subsequently had a ""seizure"" like episode. 
Her
husband states her shoulders were twitching for ""about an hour""
and then she went into a fetal position and made a strange noise
with her lips for about 45 seconds. She was not aware during 
this
episode. No loss of continence. Afterwards, she was confused for
a while; could remember her name but could not remember the year
or when she was born. She received Ativan and Keppra. Denies
having these symptoms before. Denies previous hx of seizures or
family hx of seizures. CTA from OSH showed a 9 mm internal
carotid dilatation and she was transferred to ___ for further
workup.

Neurosurgery reviewed the CTA images and concluded the finding 
is
a dilatation of the take off of the ICA and not an aneurysm.
Thus, she does not require neurosurgery follow up at this time.
Neurology was consulted while the patient was in the ED. Neuro
exam was significant only for drowsiness. Differential includes
opioid-provoked seizure, convulsive syncope, orthostatic 
syncope.
She takes a regular dose of bupropion, which can lower seizure
threshold, but she has been on this medication for a long time
and there has been no recent changes. She was admitted to
medicine for rule out endocarditis. No fevers in the ED but
patient had ""subjective fevers"" prior to admission.

In the ED, UDS was positive for opioids and cocaine. UA negative
for infection. CK elevated at 260. She was given IVF, gabapentin
800 mg, bupropion 200mg and clonidine 0.1 mg.

___ Cardiovascular Transthoracic Echo Report 
CONCLUSION: The left atrial volume index is moderately 
increased. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 
2D/ color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with a borderline increased/dilated cavity. There are moderate 
to extensive areas of severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to 
apical anterior wall, distal third of the left ventricle, mid to 
apical inferior wall and septum (see schematic). No thrombus or 
mass is seen in the left ventricle. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 30%. Left ventricular cardiac 
index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect 
is seen. Tissue Doppler suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP less than 12mmHg). Moderately dilated 
right ventricular cavity with normal free wall motion. The 
aortic sinus is mildly dilated with a mildly dilated ascending 
aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a mildly dilated 
descending aorta. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate 
to severe regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. 
Dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Mild 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of 
___ , the left ventricular systolic function is more 
reduced with extensive regional dysfunction. The right ventricle 
is now dilated and pulmonary artery pressures are elevated

___ Cardiovascular ___ MD ___ 
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel. This vessel bifurcates into the
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is
a 100% stenosis in the proximal segment. There is a moderate 
thrombus in the proximal segment. There
is a moderate thrombus in the mid segment. There is a 99% 
stenosis in the mid segment.
The ___ Diagonal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium 
caliber vessel.
The ___ Diagonal, arising from the mid segment, is a small 
caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.
The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a 
medium caliber vessel.

a large caliber vessel.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Interventional Details Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad 
hoc basis based on the coronary angiographic findings from the 
diagnostic portion of this procedure. 
The procedure was not feasible without moderate sedation. Risks, 
benefits and alternatives were discussed and informed consent 
obtained. With rhythm, blood pressure and oxygen saturation 
monitors, constant nursing observation, and direct attending 
supervision, the patient received an appropriate level of 
sedation (see medication list ). The attending was at the 
bedside continuously for 55 min during sedation. The patient was 
subsequently observed with serial examinations until the return 
of pre-sedation mental status. A ___ Fr. EBU 3.5 provided good 
support for the procedure. A short RUnthrough wire crossed into 
D2 easily. We then used a Prowater to cross into the distal LAD. 
We DOttered the lesion with a 2.0 mm balloon and then 
pre-dialted at 12 ATM distally and proximally. We then delivered 
a 2.5*26 mm Onyx DES at 18 ATM and then post-dilated with a 2.75 
mm NC balloon; we then stented with a 3.0*30 mm Onyx DES at 18 
ATM and post-dilated with a 3.5 mm NC balloon. FInal angiogram 
revealed TIMI3 flow, no residual and no visible evidence of 
dissection or rupture.

EKG: tachycardic to the 130s, Afib/aflutter. Left axis. STE 
V2-V6
c/w strain pattern, no reciprocal changes. 
 
___ 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The patient exercised for 5
minutes 30 seconds according to ___ treadmill protocol ___
METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 141 bpm and a peak blood
pressure of 202/98 mmHg. The test was stopped because of fatigue
and leg pain. This level of exercise represents a limited
exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the ECG 
showed
borderline ischemic ST wave changes (see exercise report for
details). There is resting hypertension with normal blood
pressure and heart rate responses to stress. 

Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 82 bpm and a
blood pressure of 150/84 mmHg. These demonstrated normal 
regional
and global left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular
free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated mild mitral
regurgitation with no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or
significant resting LVOT gradient. 

Echo images were acquired within 67 seconds after peak stress at
heart rates of 136-114 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate
augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There was
augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. 

IMPRESSION: Limited functional exercise capacity. Borderline ECG
changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of
inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Resting hypertension.
Normal hemodynamic response to exercise. Mild mitral
regurgitation at rest.
   
___ EXERCISE STRESS TEST:  IMPRESSION: Non-specific EKG
changes in the absence of anginal symptoms. Fair exercise
tolerance. Echo report sent separately - > Borderline ECG 
changes
in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible
ischemia to achieved workload

ECHO ___:
Conclusions   
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the basal-mid inferior wall and
hypokinesis of the majority of the left ventricle sparing the
basal to mid anterior and lateral walls. Overall left 
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (Quantitative (biplane)
LVEF = 25%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis or
regurgitation are not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation 
is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a
very high right atrial pressure.] There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Severe regional and global systolic and diastolic
dysfunction of the left ventricle, consistent with multivessel
coronary disease. Dilated right ventricle with moderate to 
severe
free wall hypokinesis and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mildly
dilated aortic root. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.   

CT Chest
1. Multiple subacute nondisplaced to minimally displaced 
right-sided rib 
fractures as described above.  No pneumothorax. 
2.  Mild paraseptal emphysema. 
3.  No evidence of interstitial lung disease. 
4.  Trace right non hemorrhagic pleural effusion. 
5.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
6.  Partially visualized bilateral hydronephrosis, better 
characterized on ___. 

CT Torso
1. Marked enlargement of the urinary bladder and severe 
bilateral 
hydroureteronephrosis. Presence of bladder wall trabeculation 
and diverticula 
likely reflects chronic bladder outlet obstruction.  Findings 
suggest acute on 
chronic bladder outlet obstruction. 
2. Small bilateral scrotal hydroceles. 
3. No evidence of ___ gangrene. 
4. Diffuse anasarca with trace amount of fluid along the fascial 
planes of the 
pelvis and lower extremities, likely third spacing. 
5. Moderate right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion. 
6. Moderate cardiomegaly with right atrial enlargement.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMH 
significant for HL with ABVD and mantle radiation (___), early 
coronary artery disease s/p PCI to LMCA and RCA (___) with RCA 
instent re-stenosis and RCA re-stent (___) who is admitted for 
a LHC after a positive stress test in the outpatient setting. 

Mrs ___ describes a long history of intermittent 
pericarditis. Her symptoms have been under control. However, 
around the beginning of ___ she began experiencing what she 
initially thought were GERD symptoms, however, this progressed 
to a 'sensation of cold and pressure' that she was unable to 
fully articulate, but what she describes to be reminiscent of 
her prior angina. 

I calledMrs ___ outpatient cardiologist (Dr ___ 
 to discuss her recent history and to corroborate some of Mrs 
___ story. Because of her ongoing symptoms, a TTE and 
then a stress echo were performed ___: She did develop chest 
pain symptoms on the treadmill with associated EKG > 1.5mm 
depressions in inferolateral leads. (previous stress tests had 
not demonstrated any ST changes) LVEF was 60% at rest 70% post 
exercise, no focal WMA post exercise. Dr ___ an 
elective admission for catheterization, but Mrs ___ became 
very stressed the evening of ___ with the results of her 
stress test and developed chest pains. She called in to Dr ___ 
___ referred her to the ED for more immediate admission and 
catheterization. Also of note, she had a small anterior apical 
perfusion on TTE seen on ___ in Dr ___. Reportedly 
stable from prior echo - though to be from viral pericarditis 
(which she has recurrent episodes of vs angina sequalle) She was 
started on colchicine ___ which did not help with her symptoms 
and caused her diarrhea - subsequently changed to ibuprofen. 
Aspirin was recently increased to 325mg daily in preparation for 
LHC.

suggestive of active sinusitis. 

___ CXR
Severe cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement appears 
worsened since the prior study.  Central pulmonary vascular 
engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. 

___ TTE 
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global 
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A 
bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve 
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion 
and transvalvular gradients. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis 
is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with 
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is 
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular 
systolic function. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
Well-functioning mechanical aortic and mitral valve prostheses. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.  

___ Exercise Stress Test 
 
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a h/o HTN, MVR and AVR 
was 
referred to the lab for evaluation of a syncopal event, 
shortness of 
breath and chest discomfort. The patient exercised for 3.5 
minutes of a 
15 W incremental bicycle ergometer protocol and the test was 
stopped at 
the patients request for shortness of breath and dizziness. The 
estimated peak MET capacity is 3.9, representing a poor 
functional 
capacity for his age. At peak exercise the patient reported 
sudden onset 
of ___ left sided chest pressure, which slowly resolved with 
rest by 
10 minutes of recovery. The patient also reported progressive 
dyspnea. 
In the presence of baseline NSSTTWs there were no significant ST 
segment 
changes seen with exercise or during recovery. The rhythm was 
atrial 
fibrillation with rare isolated VPBs vs. aberrancy 
post-exercise. 
Blunted HR response to exercise in the absence of beta blockade. 
Slight 
increase in SBP during stage I of exercise with a 10 mmHg drop 
in SBP at 
peak exercise accompanied by dizziness. 
IMPRESSION: Atypical anginal type symptoms in the absence of 
ischemic 
EKG changes at very low workload. Symptomatic drop in SBP at 
peak 
exercise. Abnormal HR response to exercise. Poor functional 
capacity. 
Clinical correlation suggested. 

___ Carotid U/S
No evidence of atherosclerotic disease in the bilateral carotid 
vasculature.

 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Right lower lobe consolidation.  
 2. Irregular scarring and retraction with nodular opacities in 
the right upper lung. Recommend CT to exclude a neoplastic 
lesion.  
 3. Hyperinflated lungs with emphysematous changes.  
 LUE Ultrasound ___  
 IMPRESSION:  
 No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper 
extremity.  
 CXR ___  
 IMPRESSION:  
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again 
is severe COPD with bullous disease with scarring and distortion 
of the pulmonary architecture. The probably little change in the 
opacification at the right base. However, there is some 
increasing opacification at the left base that could represent 
superimposed new consolidation. No definite evidence of 
pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 TTE ___  
 The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined.. There is a very small circumferential 
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.  
 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.  
 
CT Chest ___: 
1. Masslike consolidation in the right upper lobe may be sequela 
of aspiration/pneumonia in the setting of significant mucous 
plugging and changes of aspiration pneumonia at the lung bases, 
a followup chest radiograph 4 weeks is recommended to ensure 
resolution, if this consolidation does not resolve 
then a CT chest with contrast should be obtained at this time to 
exclude underlying malignancy. 
2. Severe emphysema. 
3. Moderate nonhemorrhagic pericardial effusion.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, abdominal pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization (___)

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o ___ woman from ___ 
with h/o of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy p/w with lower 
abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, shortness of breath, and 
bilateral lower extremity edema. 
 The patient consulted today for 2 weeks of worsening shortness 
of breath on exertion, which has limited her activities of daily 
living. She also associated a dry cough, increased lower 
extremity swelling, and abdominal pain during this period. Her 
abdominal pain is constant, she mentions that her abdomen ""feels 
heavy"". The pain is located in her lower abdomen, and is 
associated with a sensation of bloating, without nausea or 
vomiting. She has not had any recent weight loss or changes in 
her bowel habits. She denies any chest pain or 
lightheadedness/syncope during this period. During the past few 
years she has occasional chest pain that usually is relieved 
with PRN SL NTG. The last time she had chest pain was 1 month 
ago.  
  She was seen at ___ in ___ 3 days ago, given antacid 
medication at that time, no labs or x-rays obtained at that 
time. Today the patient consulted to her PCP's office, and there 
she was found to be tachypneic with SpO2 93% at rest and with 
ambulation, and had an elevated D-dimer, therefore she was 
referred to the ED. 
 In the ED initial vitals were: BP: 135/75 Pulse: 100 Temp: 
96.7F Resp: 30 SpO2: 93% RA  
 EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with occasional 
ventricular bigeminy, Flipped T waves in v3, and ___levation in v2 when compared to EKG ___. Troponin was elevated 
at 0.07, and her proBNP was 7653. A CTA of the chest was (-) for 
pulmonary embolism and showed mild pulmonary edema. She was 
given full dose aspirin, 20mg IV Furosemide and put on a heparin 
gtt. 
 Of note, her outpatient cardiology notes the patient has a long 
history of ischemic heart disease, and a previous (+) T.cruzi 
serology. She is frequently non-compliant with her appointments 
and medications. They have recommended her to undergo cardiac 
catheterization and AICD placement, but she has refused so far. 
 On arrival to the floor the patient denies chest pain or 
lightheadedness, and she says that her shortness of breath has 
improved.

IMAGING STUDIES AND CATHETERIZATION
CTA CHEST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE:  Main pulmonary artery is mildly dilated 
measuring 3.3 
cm suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.  Pulmonary 
vasculature is well 
opacified to the subsegmental level without filling defect to 
indicate a 
pulmonary embolus.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber 
without evidence 
of dissection or intramural hematoma.  The heart is moderately 
enlarged with 
left ventricular and left atrial dilatation.  No pericardial 
effusion. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM:  Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph 
nodes are 
likely reactive and do not meet CT size criteria for 
enlargement.  
Representative lower paratracheal node measures 0.9 cm (03:35).  
No 
supraclavicular, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  
No 
mediastinal mass. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES:  No pneumothorax.  Large right and small left 
non hemorrhagic 
layering pleural effusions are noted.  No pleural calcification. 

  
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS:  Mild right lower lobe and right middle lobe 
atelectasis.  
Heterogeneous diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with 
interlobular 
septal thickening is most consistent with combination of 
moderate air trapping 
given expiratory phase scan and mild pulmonary edema.  No 
pulmonary masses or 
nodules.  No cavitary lesions.  Mild bronchial wall thickening 
suggestive of 
small airways disease.  The airways are otherwise patent to the 
level of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally. 
  
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
ABDOMEN:  Included portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. 

  
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2.  Mild pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly with large right 
and small 
left pleural effusions. 
3.  Small airways disease with moderate air-trapping and 
bronchial wall 
thickening.  No mucous plugs. 
4.  Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension. 
CHEST X RAY ___
FINDINGS:  
  
The lungs are mildly hypoinflated.  Stable small bilateral 
pleural effusions, 
larger on the right.  No pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous bilateral 
perihilar 
opacities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Stable 
moderate 
cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Mild pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral 
pleural 
effusions. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy (the posterior wall is thin and 
fibrotic). The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. LV 
systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF 
= 30%) secondary to inferior and posterior akinesis. A 
posterobasal aneurysm is present. The right ventricular free 
wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of 
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric 
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

persistent
regional edema and similar regional mass effect including 
leftward midline
shift.
2. Heterogenous slow diffusion centrally with new areas of slow 
diffusion
along the superior margins of the lesion, possibly related to 
combination of
decreasing abscess components and superimposed postprocedural 
sequela.

Pertinent Results:
OSH head CT: 
4.5x3.5x3.0cm mass in the pineal gland with obstructive 
hydrocephalus at the level of the aqueduct with mass effect on 
the midbrain and corpus collosum.

___ 10:16 AM - MR ___ W/O CONTRAST  
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of osseous or intrathecal metastatic disease. 
2. No cord signal abnormality. 
3. Overall mild spinal spondylosis, as detailed above, most 
notable for 
posterior disc bulges with central protrusion at the L4-L5 and 
L5-S1 levels, with annular fissure at the L5-S1. 

___ 10:13 AM - MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS 
1. 3.7 x 3.3 x 4.5 cm mildly enhancing mass with calcifications, 
as detailed above, likely arising from the lining of the 
cerebral aqueduct or tectal plate rather than the pineal gland 
given the pattern of mass effect.  It should be noted that large 
size of the mass precludes confident assessment of origin.  
Though the etiology is unclear, given the totality of imaging 
findings,   ependymoma is favored.  Differential possibilities 
include meningioma, choroid plexus papilloma, and 
oligodendroglioma, though these are considered less likely, for 
reasons as stated above.  Tumors arising from the pineal gland 
such as  pineocytoma or germ cell tumor are considered highly 
unlikely, as anatomically, this mass cannot arise from the 
pineal gland.  Finally, metastasis is considered unlikely given 
the imaging characteristics. 
2. Large mass effaces the cerebral aqueduct and results in 
severe obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal edema as 
seen on the outside hospital CT examination. 
3. No hemorrhage or infarct. 

___. Status post frontal approach ventriculostomy, terminating in 
the third 
ventricle with postsurgical changes.  No intracranial hemorrhage 
or 
territorial infarct. 
2. Stable hyperdense mass in the region of the pineal gland and 
the tectal 
plate. 

___ CTV
1. Large mass in the pineal region with coarse calcifications, 
is better 
evaluated on the prior MRI from ___. 
2. Interval improvement in the ventriculomegaly status post 
right frontal EVD placement.  Appropriate postsurgical changes 
including small extra-axial hematoma and right frontal 
pneumocephalus. 
3. Unremarkable CTA of the head. 
4. The mass appears to splay the internal cerebral veins on the 
CTV, with the right internal cerebral vein appearing to coarse 
through the substance of the mass or adjacent to the mass.  
There is no definite occlusion of flow of the vein.  The 
remainder of the dural venous sinuses are patent.

___ MRI WAND
1. Unchanged heterogeneous 3.7 x 3.4 x 4.6 cm mass in the region 
of the pineal gland. 
2. Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter in place, 
with unchanged ventriculomegaly compared to ___, 
though improved compared to ___. 

___ MRV
1. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. 
2. Large mass in the region of the pineal gland with splaying of 
the internal cerebral veins, is better assessed on the prior 
examinations. 

___ Intra-operative Head CT
1. Unchanged heterogeneous mass in the region of the pineal 
gland. 
2. Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged 
in position. 
3. Ventriculomegaly is improved compared to the prior study from 
___. 
4. Examination performed with stereotactic frame in position. 

___ - Post-operative Head CT without Contrast:
1. Status post biopsy of the pineal region mass with 
postsurgical changes. 
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or new acute large territory 
infarct. 
3. Stable left frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter. 
4. Hyperdense mass in the region of the pineal gland and tectal

PERTINENT STUDIES
======================
CT HEAD NON CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
There is a 4.9 x 2.6 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left 
temporal 
septal lobe.  Thickening of the left tentorial leaflet likely 
reflects and 
unchanged a subdural hematoma.  Left frontotemporal subdural 
hematomas are 
also unchanged.  There is a small amount of blood suspected 
within the 
interpeduncular fossa (03:17).  A small amount of hemorrhage may 
also be seen 
within the atrium of the left lateral ventricle (___:24).  There 
is no midline 
shift.  The ventricular size is unchanged however there is 
obliteration of the 
temporal horn of the left lateral ventricle, unchanged.  The 
basal cisterns 
are patent. 
  
There is no acute fracture identified.  There is mild mucosal 
thickening of 
the right maxillary sinus.  Soft tissue swelling over the left 
posterior scalp 
is present.  The orbits are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Overall no significant interval change in a left temporal 
occipital 
intraparenchymal hematoma with associated subdural hemorrhage 
along the left 
tentorial leaflet and left frontotemporal region.  New small 
volume blood in 
the interpeduncular fossa and atrium of the left lateral 
ventricle likely 
reflects redistribution of blood products. 
  
No midline shift or interval change in mass effect. 

MRI BRAIN W/ AND W/O CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
Limited examination due to patient motion, within this 
limitation, again seen 
is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal occipital 
lobes, which 
allowing for differences in technique, is stable to slightly 
increased in 
size, previously measuring 4.9 x 2.6 cm, now measuring 5.2 x 2.5 
cm (8:9).  
Peripheral susceptibility and enhancement is in keeping with 
hemorrhage; no 
definite nodular enhancement.  A small fluid fluid level in the 
dependent 
posterior left lateral ventricle may suggest a component of 
intraventricular 
hemorrhage.  Allowing for differences in modality, small left 
subdural 
hematoma along the left convexity and tentorial leaflet, is 
stable.  The dural 
venous sinuses appear patent.  Scattered areas of sulcal FLAIR 
signal may 
suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
  
Moderate perilesional vasogenic edema has slightly increased, 
although there 
is stable near complete effacement of the temporal horn of the 
left lateral 
ventricle and stable adjacent sulcal effacement.  The lateral 
ventricles and 
basal cisterns otherwise remain patent.  No midline shift. 
  
There is mild mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus 
and anterior 
ethmoid air cells. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Allowing for differences in technique, left temporal 
occipital 
intraparenchymal hematoma is stable to slightly increased, 
previously 
measuring 4.9 x 2.6 cm, now measuring 5.2 x 2.5 cm.  No findings 
to suggest 
underlying lesion, although it is too early to fully evaluate 
and should be 
followed up on subsequent studies.  No evidence of associated 
dural venous 
sinus thrombosis. 
2. Stable small subdural hematoma with question of mild 
scattered subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. 
3. Question of minimal intraventricular hemorrhage within the 
posterior horn 
of the left lateral ventricle.  Follow-up is advised. 
4. Mild paranasal sinus disease. 

CT HEAD NON CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
Allowing for differences in technique, left temporal occipital 
lobe 
intraparenchymal hematoma is decreased in size, previously 
measuring 5.2 x 2.5 
cm in the axial plane, now measuring 4.2 x 2.0 cm (02:15).  
Degree of 
perilesional vasogenic edema is stable to questionably slightly 
increased, 
although local mass effect is unchanged, including near complete 
effacement of 
the temporal horn of the left lateral ventricle and adjacent 
sulcal 
effacement.  The configuration of the ventricles and sulci is 
stable without 
significant midline shift.  The basal cisterns are patent. 
  
Small left subdural hematoma along the left tentorial leaflet is 
grossly 
stable.  Additionally, the degree of subdural fluid along the 
left convexity 
is stable as well, measuring up to 3 mm in greatest dimension, 
although less 
hypodense than prior, possibly due to evolution. 
  
There has been interval increase in small amount of layering 
blood within the 
posterior right lateral ventricle.  Small degree of 
intraventricular 
hemorrhage within the left lateral ventricle cannot be excluded. 
 No acute 
large territory infarction. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  Other than mild mucosal 
thickening of the 
right maxillary sinus, the visualized portion of the paranasal 
sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The 
visualized portion 
of the orbits are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Decreased size of left temporal occipital lobe 
intraparenchymal hematoma 
with stable to questionably slightly increased perilesional 
vasogenic edema.  
The degree of local mass effect on the temporal horn of the left 
lateral 
ventricle and adjacent sulci is stable, as is the overall 
configuration of the 
ventricles.  No evidence of herniation. 
2. Increased small volume intraventricular hemorrhage within the 
right lateral 
ventricle.  Tiny intraventricular hemorrhage within the left 
lateral ventricle 
cannot be excluded. 
3. Similar degree of subdural fluid along the left convexity 
with decreased 
attenuation may suggest evolving small subdural hematoma, 
although component 
of subdural effusion cannot be excluded. 
4. Stable small left subdural hematoma along the left tentorial 
leaflet. 
5. Paranasal sinus disease. 

KUB ___
FINDINGS:  
  
Study is limited due to patient body habitus and paucity of gas, 
especially 
within the small bowel.  Within this limitation, there are no 
distended loops 
of small or large bowel to suggest ileus or obstruction. 
There is no free intraperitoneal air. 
Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
There are no unexplained soft tissue calcifications or 
radiopaque foreign 
bodies. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Nonspecific, nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. 

CT HEAD NON CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS:  
  
The study is partially limited in the setting of dental amalgam 
streak 
artifact. 
  
There is redemonstration of left temporal-occipital lobe 
intraparenchymal 
hematoma, unchanged in size and appearance compared to prior 
study dated ___.  There is stable adjacent vasogenic edema with mild 
partial 
effacement of the left lateral ventricle and extensive 
effacement of the left 
hemispheric sulci.  There is approximately 2 mm of left right 
midline shift, 
not seen on prior study.  The basal cisterns are patent.  There 
is a stable 
small left anterior temporal subdural hematoma, unchanged.  
There is interval 
decrease in the small amount of layering hemorrhage within the 
atrium of the 
right lateral ventricle.  There is no evidence of new 
intracranial hemorrhage, 
acute large territorial infarction, or mass. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  There is mild mucosal 
thickening of the 
right maxillary sinus, unchanged.  The visualized portion of the 
mastoid air 
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized 
portion of the 
orbits are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1.  Dental amalgam streak artifact limits study. 
2. Grossly stable left temporal-occipital lobe intraparenchymal 
hematoma and 
adjacent vasogenic edema. 
3. New approximately 2 mm left to right midline shift. 
4. Grossly stable left anterior temporal subdural hematoma. 
5. Interval decrease in the small amount of layering hemorrhage 
in the right 
lateral ventricle. 
6. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous cholecystostomy

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI
___ hx CAD s/p PCI, CMP of uncertain etiology (EF 35% on ___ OSH TTE). She developed chest and back pain, was brought to 
___ by EMS, and was transferred to ___ ED. 
Here, she was found by a circuitous path to have acute 
cholecystitis, and is admitted to medicine after a perc biliary 
drain. 

The patient was in her usual health* (see paragraph about her 
CHF symptoms, below) since after her catheterization on 
___. In the past week, she suffered a bout of viral 
gastroenteritis, first with profuse vomiting and then diarrhea; 
states she has lost about 6 lbs (measuring her weight at home 
for CHF as instructed. The day prior to admission, she developed 
the onset of (1) worsening central chest pressure (similar to 
her typical chest pain symptom) without radiation to jaw or 
arms; and (2) severe pain across her upper back (not a usual 
symptom for her). Both pains were constant, with waxing and 
waning quality and not worsened by position or activity.No 
diaphoresis, palpitations. She has 100% DAPT adherence. She 
called her outpatient cardiologist's office, who directed her to 
the ED based on new symptoms and recent stents.

EMS initially brought the pt to ___, where she 
received full dose ASA, nitroglycerin (unclear if SLN or IV). 
She had no pain relief with these measures, but did develop 
nausea with the nitro. She was then transported to ___ ED.

In the ___ ED
- initial VS: 98.9 74 107/69 16 98% RA
- labs: cbc with wbc 11.5, otherwise unremarkable. chemistry 
with HCO3 17, BUN/Cr ___, Ca 7.5 Mg 1.5 Phos 2.0. LFTs with 
ALT AST 45/49, AP and Tbili normal. Lipase 25. UA without 
evidence of UTI. 
- CXR initially concerning for pneumomediastinum but CT chest 
without any pneumomediastinum. CT did show findings concerning 
for acute cholecystitis. 
- Cardiology was consulted; recommendations below.
- Thoracic surgery consulted for ? pneumomediastinum; reviewed 
films and agrees no evidence of pneumomediastinum. 
- ACS was consulted for acute cholecystectomy; they felt CCY 
would be higher risk in this patient and recommended PTBD by ___.
- ___ was consulted; the patient was taken for US guided ___ perc 
chole. This procedure was notable for a larger quantity of 
bloody output than was expected during typical PTBD, so 
additional US was performed (see below). 
- Other interventions: Plavix, PPI, acetaminophen, GI cocktail, 
dilaudid IV, MVI

Admitted to Medicine for further evaluation.
VS were stable on transfer: 98.1 103 ___ 99% RA.

Regarding her PTBD placement: 
I spoke to one of the ___ providers (Dr. ___ who 
performed her procedure. They performed US-guided perc chole 
placement. Initially bile drained. There was some initial blood 
in the perc chole tube (which is expected); however, it 
continued for a longer time than expected. This could be due to 
the pt being on DAPT. However, initial US prior to perc chole 
placement showed anechoic GB contents; post-procedure US showed 
a decompressed gallbladder with contents having an echotexture 
most consistent with blood products. Clinically, there was no 
frank hemorrhage from the PTBD. The ___ team performed RUQUS 
immediately after tube placement, which did not show any free 
fluid or evidence of perihepatic hemorrhage. They waited an 
additional ___ minutes and repeated the RUQUS without any 
evidence of abdominal free fluid or perihepatic hemorrhage. They 
expect that, due to DAPT, it may take several days for the PTBD 
drainage to stop being bloody. They would like to get H/H in 
next ___. 

Regarding her present chest pain, Cardiology consult noted: 
 ""Patient seen and examined. Having central chest/epigastric 
pain constant since ___ today. Feels different than prior 
angina pain. Patient had 2.5x16 mm Promus Premier DES to mLAD by 
Dr. ___ ___. ECG with V5-6 TW flattening/sub-mm 
STD. Biomarkers negative.
 ""CXR initially concerning for pneumomediastinum but CT chest 
without any pneumomediastinum. CT did show findings concerning 
for acute cholecystitis.
 ""If cholecystectomy is felt to be indicated, she may proceed to 
surgery provided she can continue on aspirin & clopidogrel and 
does not miss any doses given she is at high risk for stent 
thrombosis without dual antiplatelet therapy. If she is unable 
to tolerate PO, would give rectal aspirin and consult cardiology 
for likely need for IV Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban) or 
___ inhibitor (cangrelor) gtt.
 ""Discussed with consult attending Dr. ___

On arrival, patient reports feeling much improved. She continues 
to have pain under the R rib margin. She does not have any 
nausea or vomiting. She feels thirst. She continues to have a 
mild sensation of central chest pressure, but this has been 
constant for several weeks-months and was one of the symptoms 
that prompted her catheterization by Dr. ___ in ___.

Regarding her cardiac symptoms, she tells me her cath was 
prompted by several months of worsening central chest pressure 
and dyspnea. She has been told she has a ""cardiomyopathy,"" 
though unclear from what etiology; Dr. ___ has referred 
her to ___ for further evaluation, none of which has 
occurred as yet. She states she becomes dyspneic with walking 
down the hallway at work, and even sometimes with bending over 
to put on socks and shoes to get dressed. She has waxing and 
waning central chest pressure most of the time (with the 
features described above). Denies orthopnea, PND. Denies 
palpitations.

Regarding potential risk factors for cardiomyopathy: She drinks 
alcohol socially; in particular, states that she goes out 
perhaps once a week with friends, and has 3 mixed drinks at the 
bar. Does not typically drink at home. Has not used cocaine or 
methamphetamines. Previously smoked 1ppd x ___ but now quit. 
Does not carry dx of OSA; has poor quality sleep for many years, 
but cannot comment on snoring (has no present bed partner). She 
does not have personal or family history of autoimmune disease, 
and states she's had extensive workup for autoimmune disease at 
___ requested by Dr. ___ her CMP. She has no 
history of thyroid disease.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ female with a history of multinodular 
goiter, osteoporosis, hypertension.  She presents with a chief 
complaint of bilateral thigh pain and fatigue over the past 2 to 
3 weeks. She was admitted from our ED for acute renal failure. 

Patient states that she first noticed bilateral thigh pain 
approximately 3 weeks ago. She states that the pain has a 
burning quality, otherwise she has difficulty describing the 
pain. Specifically, she cannot tell me how long the pain lasts 
when it comes on, and she is not sure whether it started 
suddenly or if it came on subacutely.  The pain was 
significantly limiting her mobility at home.  She cannot 
identify any specific movements that exacerbate the pain. 

Because of the pain, she started taking 10 Advil's a day and 7 
Tylenols per day over the last 3-weeks.  She has had decreased 
p.o. intake over the past 2 to 3 weeks as well.  Per the husband 
she is only been taking a couple sips of water a day and has 
only been eating 1 small meal per day.  When asked if the 
patient had loss of appetite over this time frame, she states 
that she is not sure.  She denies any blood in her stool or dark 
stools or any other sources of bleeding.

Patient also describes increasing fatigue over this timeframe. 
Specifically she has had difficulty getting in and out of her 
bed. She has also relied on a wheelchair for the past 1 to 2 
days.  At baseline she uses a cane to get around.  Husband 
reports having to assist the patient walks around the home and
assist patient with ADLs which is not her baseline. The husband 
states that the patient has ""collapsed slowly"" 2 times in the 
past 3 weeks. No head strike noted. The patient denies any 
lightheadedness or other symptoms prior to these ""collapsing"" 
episodes.  Husband was concerned with this change in her 
baseline functional status and scheduled an appointment with her 
PCP ___ ___.  

In the ED the patient was noted to have a new ___ and 
hemodynamic instability (heart rates in the low 100s to 110s and 
systolic blood pressures in the ___ was given 2 L of normal 
saline and sent to the floor for management of ARF.
 
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient intermittently reports 
pain in legs. She is oriented to place and person but cannot 
recall the year. Her attention/concentration is also impaired.

denies suicidal ideation or plan. States that he couldn't cause 
that kind of harm to the rest of his family.

The patient had a nuclear perfusion ___ that showed ""Probably 
normal myocardial perfusion. Inferior wall defect most 
consistent with attenuation."" 

The patient drank a 375cc bottle of ___ before 
coming into the hospital today. He states he drinks this about 
twice a week, and does not drink on other days. He has been 
drinking more since his father died, but he states he drank much 
more in the distant past.

The patient also complains of ___ left hip pain. He has 
avascular necrosis from being on several years of steroids 
decades ago. He is s/p right hip replacement. He states no one 
will do a left hip replacement because he is on aspirin, Plavix, 
and xarelto.

(-18.3 %; normal less than
-18%) Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

CONCLUSION: The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal 
cavity size. There is mild-moderate left ventricular regional 
systolic dysfunction (see schematic). Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 50-55%. There is mild [1+] 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: 1) Low normal global LV systolic function with mild 
regional variation in contractility suggesting CAD in the LCX 
territory. 2) Moderate systolic systemic arterial hypertension.

FINDINGS:  
  
There is an acute subdural hematoma layering along the left 
cerebral convexity and the left tentorium.  The maximum 
thickness of this blood collection is 11 mm, unchanged from 
prior exam.  There is 6 mm of rightward midline shift with mild 
effacement of the left lateral ventricle and the left cerebral 
sulci, similar to prior exam.  No new focus of acute hemorrhage 
is seen.  No evidence of infarction or mass. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  There is mucosal thickening 
in the frontal sinuses and anterior ethmoid air cells.  
Otherwise, the visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The 
visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable.

Persistent bilateral reticular opacities as demonstrated 
previously.  
Differential diagnosis includes edema.  An atypical infectious 
process cannot be excluded.  Findings may, at least in part, 
reflect chronic interstitial lung disease.  
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with aneurysmal 
dilatation of the aorta. 

___ ___:
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, 
and systolic function. Due to the beat to beat variation in 
systolic function, it is difficult to determine the presence of 
wall motion abnormalities. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mildly 
enlarged thoracic and abdominal aorta. Mild pulmonary artery

Pathology
___ Liver biopsy:

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, needle core biopsy:
1. Established cirrhosis.
2. Moderate lobular neutrophilic infiltrate.
3. Moderate portal, periportal and lobular mixed inflammation 
comprised of lymphocytes, neutrophils,
 rare eosinophils and plasma cells with prominent lobular 
disarray, and numerous apoptotic
hepatocytes.
4. Scattered cells with intracytoplasmic hyalin material.
5. Marked bile duct proliferation and damage with associated 
neutrophils and intraductal cholestasis.
6. Mild microvesicular steatosis, frequent ballooning 
degeneration and intracytoplasmic hyaline
seen.
5. Minimal steatosis seen.
6. Iron stain shows no increased stainable iron.
7. Reticulin stain shows no evidence of collapse.
Note: Overall, the histologic features are consistent with 
established cirrhosis with features of toxic/metabolic injury. 

IMAGING / STUDIES:

RENAL US ___:

FINDINGS: 
 
The right kidney measures 11.4 cm. The left kidney measures 12.9 
cm.  The
kidneys are diffusely echogenic suggestive of renal disease 
under.  There isno hydronephrosis or shadowing calculi 
bilaterally.
 
The urinary bladder is decompressed.
 
There is moderate to large volume ascites, as on prior.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis. Echogenic kidneys suggest renal designed.
2. Moderate to large volume ascites.

CXR PA/LAT ___:

 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Comparison to ___.  No relevant change is noted.  Low 
lung volumes. 
Moderate cardiomegaly.  Small right pleural effusion with 
subsequent right
atelectasis, better visualized on the lateral than on the 
frontal view. 
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumonia.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US ___:

FINDINGS: 
 
Liver: The hepatic contour is slightly undulating.  No focal 
liver lesions are identified.  There is mild ascites. 

Bile ducts:  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  
The common hepatic duct measures 3 mm. 

Gallbladder:  The gallbladder appears decompressed with wall 
thickening and pericholecystic fluid likely due to third 
spacing.  There is gallbladder sludge.

Pancreas:  The pancreas is largely obscured by overlying bowel 
gas, with
imaged portions of the pancreas appearing within normal limits.

Spleen:  The spleen demonstrates normal echotexture, and 
measures 17.0 cm.

Kidneys: Limited view of the right kidney demonstrates no 
hydronephrosis.
 
Doppler evaluation:
 
The main portal vein is patent, with reversal flow.
Main portal vein velocity is 31 cm/sec.
Right and left portal veins are patent, with reversed direction 
of flow.
 
The main hepatic artery is patent, with appropriate waveform.
Right, middle and left hepatic veins are patent, with 
appropriate waveforms.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Patent hepatic vasculature with reversal of flow in the 
portal veins.
2. Small volume ascites.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Slight undulation of the hepatic contour without focal lesion 
seen.
5. Pericholecystic fluid likely due to third spacing.

CXR PA+LAT ___
Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung 
volumes with
exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular 
crowding.  Even
allowing for this, the heart is likely mildly enlarged.  There 
is improved
opacification compared to ___.  However, more focal 
consolidations
bilaterally are suggestive persistent multifocal pneumonia.  
Mild pulmonary
edema is persistent.  There is trace, if any, right pleural 
effusion.  No left
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
IMPRESSION: Improved but persistent multifocal pneumonia.  Mild 
pulmonary edema.

CXR Portable ___
Endotracheal tube, right IJ central line, and enteric tube are 
unchanged
position.  There is again seen diffuse airspace opacities 
bilaterally which
are unchanged.  There is unchanged cardiomegaly.  No 
pneumothoraces are seen.

KUB ___

Enteric tube tip is in the distal stomach.  There is single 
air-filled,
nondilated loop of bowel in the right abdomen, likely ascending 
colon. 
Relative paucity of bowel loops elsewhere throughout abdomen.
 
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of bowel dilatation.

CXR Portable ___

IMPRESSION: 
ET tube tip is is 5.3 cm above the carinal.  Right internal 
jugular line tip
is at the level of lower SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
stable,
top-normal.  There is slight interval improvement in widespread 
parenchymal
consolidations most likely reflecting improvement of pulmonary 
edema/ARDS. 
Small pleural effusion is seen but no large effusion is present. 
 No
pneumothorax.","Ascites, Jaundice, Transfer",2.0,96.0,81.0,18.0,56.0,94.0,97.8,1,30506353,ED,Emergency Department,2112-04-09 21:59:00,2112-04-10 01:49:00

As per the patient, a few weeks ago, she was moving furniture in
a patient's room (patient is a ___ cardiology nurse) and felt
unusually short of breath. At baseline, she uses a stationary
bicycle at the gym for 30 minutes. She has been less physically
active than usual in the setting of a hamstring injury and 
cannot
tell if her functional capacity has changed. She checked her O2
saturation by pulse oximetry/plethysmography a few weeks ago 
with
HR 76 with seemingly regular rhythm. 

This morning the patient felt woozy while standing waiting for a
taxi to come to work. She checked her radial pulse and felt it
was thready, but not bradycardic and not obviously irregular.
After arriving at ___, she was sitting in the work room and
turned her head about 40-60 degrees off center to look at the
telemetry technician approaching her. She felt ""really crappy"",
""exceedingly weak"" and woozy. She awoke on the floor with her
colleagues standing over her, reportedly grazing her head on the
telemetry technician's seated knee as the patient slid down to
the floor. She recalls 2 other prior syncopal episodes: at age 
___
walking across the street with her mother when her mother was
struck by a bicycle; ___ years ago, she stuck herself with a 
clean
large bore needle at work and passed out while sitting down
shortly after the acute injury. Today, she had the same 
prodromal
sensation as the last two syncopal episodes. After today's loss
of consciousness, she was wretching. 

In the ED, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
Given her syncopal event, there was concern for conversion
pauses. She was sent to the ___ for further workup. Ultimately,
in the ___, the patient had another syncopal episode with what
appeared to be a long sinus pause. She had 15 seconds chest
compressions before recovering without incident.  
 
On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports that she is feeling
much better, though remains a little bit nauseous. She remembers
being awake at 1:10AM and the next thing she remembers is waking
up with a nurse over her. On review of systems does not report
fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, and
abdominal pain.

=======================================

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT - Final ___
DIAGNOSIS: MOST IN KEEPING WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, 
SEE NOTE. 
Note: Sections show an enlarged lymph node with effacement of 
the normal nodal architecture by a vague nodular proliferation 
of atypical lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are predominantly large 
in size with round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, 
vesicular chromatin and single to multiple prominent nucleoli 
giving some cells a centroblastic appearance and some cells an 
immunoblastic appearance. Scattered smaller lymphocytes are 
present. Frequent apoptotic cells, tingible body macrophages and 
mitoses are seen. 

By immunohistochemistry, CD20 highlights the large lymphoma 
cells, which are negative for CD10 and CD5 and positive for 
MUM1. BCL6 highlights a subset of the lymphoma cells in nodular 
areas with variable dim to bright staining. BCL2 is diffusely 
positive. BCL1 is negative. CD3 and CD5 highlight scattered 
background T-cells with focal aggregates forming a nodular 
outline of the B-cells. CD21 and CD23 highlight disrupted and 
fragmented follicular dendritic cell meshwork. By Ki67 (MIB1) 
staining, the proliferation index is 70-80%. 

Concurrent cytogenetics showed a complex karyotype with gain of 
BCL2 and BCL6. There is no evidence of BCL2-IGH translocation 
and BCL6 or MYC rearrangement arguing against a double hit/ 
triple hit lymphoma (see separate report""___-___"" for full 
result) 

Taken together, the morphologic and immunophenotypic features 
are in keeping with involvement by a large B-cell lymphoma. 
Although there is follicular dendritic cell meshwork's staining 
with CD21 and CD23 in the back ground, these meshworks are 
largely fragmented by large atypical B-cells that are not 
exclusively confined within these meshworks favoring a diffuse 
process. A concomitant peripheral blood clonal B- lymphocytosis 
was noted, however In the examined tissue there is no clear 
evidence of a small B-cell lymphoma component that support the 
possibility of secondary large B-cell transformation. Overall, 
it is best classified as diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
,non-germinal center type by the ___ algorithm. Correlation 
with clinical, cytogenetic (___-2410, CY19-7), flow cytometry 
(___) and laboratory findings is recommended.

IMMUNOPHENOTYPING ___
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda 
and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23, 34, 38, 
45 and 56.

RESULTS:

10-color analysis with CD45 vs. side-scatter gating is used to 
evaluate for lymphoma.

Approximately 89.5% of total acquired events are evaluable 
non-debris events.

The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 99.9%.

CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 99.7% 
of total analyzed events.

B cells demonstrate monoclonal kappa light chain restriction. 
They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20 and CD38 (dim) 
and are negative for CD10, CD11c and CD23. A minor subset of 
lymphoma cells shows dim CD5 expression.

 
T cells comprise 14.1% of lymphoid gated events and express 
mature lineage antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2 and CD7).

A minor subset (16.1%) of T cells shows dim/variable loss of CD7 
(non-specific finding).

T cells have a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.2.

There is a population of double-negative (CD4 negative/CD8 
negative) T cells comprising 10.2% of CD3 positive cells.

CD56 positive, CD3 negative natural killer cells represent 0.1% 
of gated lymphocytes.

INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a kappa 
restricted B cell lymphoma. Correlation with clinical, 
morphologic (see separate pathology report ___ and other 
ancillary findings is recommended for further characterization. 
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal 
populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample 
preparation.

CYTOGENETIS  ___
FINDINGS: An abnormal 
___ female 
chromosome complement was observed in 20 cells examined in 
detail. These cells had an extra copy of chromosomes X, 3, 7 and 
18, a derivative chromosome 12 resulting from an unbalanced 
translocation involving the long arms of a chromosome 9 and a 
chromosome 12, and 1 to 4 ring chromosomes of unknown origin 
that may be composed of a segment of chromosome 9. Chromosome 
band resolution was 425-500. A karyogram was prepared on 5 
cells. CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 
___ 

INTERPRETATION/COMMENT: Each of the metaphase right 
supraclavicular lymph node cells examined had a complex abnormal 
karyotype with trisomy 3, 7 and 18, a derivative chromosome 12 
from an unbalanced translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 12, 
and ___ ring chromosomes. The rings may be composed of a segment 
of chromosome 9 because amplification of ABL1 on ___ was 
detected by FISH (see below). The large majority of these cells 
were found in an unstimulated culture, suggesting that this 
neoplasm has a high mitotic rate. Although FISH detected extra 
intact copies of the BCL6 and BCL2 genes due to trisomy 3 and 
18, respectively, there is no evidence that this karyotype 
harbors rearrangements of the BCL6, MYC, BCL2 and IGH genes (see 
below). The BCR/ABL gene rearrangement and rearrangement of the 
MLL gene have also been excluded. These findings are consistent 
with a high grade B-cell lymphoma.
 
FISH: POSITIVE for GAIN of BCL6 and BCL2. Approximately 80% of 
the interphase right supraclavicular lymph node cells examined 
had extra intact BCL6 and BCL2 probe signals. These findings are 
due to trisomy ___ and ___ observed in the complex abnormal 
karyotype (see metaphase chromosome analysis above). There was 
no evidence of the IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangement or rearrangements 
of the BCL6 and MYC genes. These findings exclude a ""double-hit"" 
high grade B-cell lymphoma.

2) FISH: NEGATIVE CLL PANEL. No evidence of interphase right 
supraclavicular lymph node cells with the commonly observed 
cytogenetic abnormalities of prognostic significance in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia. These include: deletions of the ATM and 
TP53 genes, deletion 13q14, and trisomy 12.

3) FISH: NEGATIVE for GAIN of MDM2. No evidence of interphase 
right supraclavicular lymph node cells with an extra copy of the 
MDM2 gene. Thus, the ring chromosome observed in the metaphase 
chromosome analysis is not likely composed of the mid long arm 
of chromosome 12. 

4) FISH: POSITIVE for GAIN of CHROMOSOME 9. 19% of the 
interphase right supraclavicular lymph node cells examined had 
probe signal patterns consistent with one or two extra copies of 
chromosome 9. The ring chromosomes observed in the metaphase 
chromosomes are likely composed of part of chromosome 9. 

5) FISH: NEGATIVE for MLL REARRANGEMENT. No evidence of 
interphase right supraclavicular lymph node cells with 
rearrangement of the MLL gene. 

6) FISH: NEGATIVE for BCR/ABL, POSITIVE for AMPLIFICATION of 
ABL1. No evidence of interphase bone marrow cells with the 
BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangement. However, 75.5% of the right 
supraclavicular lymph node cells examined had multiple extra 
ABL1 signals consistent with amplification. The ring chromosomes 
observed in the metaphase chromosomes are likely composed of 
segments of chromosome 9 and multiple copies of the ABL1 gene. 

7) FISH: NEGATIVE for CCND1 REARRANGEMENT. No evidence of 
interphase right
supraclavicular lymph node cells with rearrangement of the CCND1 
gene.

PERIPHERAL BLOOD IMMUNOPHENOTYPING ___
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda 
and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23, 34, 38, 
45 and 56.
RESULTS:

They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20. There is 
dim/equivocal expression of CD5 in a subset of cells. They do 
not express any other characteristic antigens including CD10, 
CD11c, CD23, CD34 and CD38.

T cells comprise 4.8% of lymphoid gated events and express 
mature lineage antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2 and CD7).
A minor subset (11.0%) of T cells shows dim/variable loss of CD7 
(non-specific finding)
T cells have a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.8 (usual range in blood 
0.7-3.0).
CD56 positive, CD3 negative natural killer cells represent 0.2% 
of gated lymphocytes. They co-express CD2, CD7 and CD8 (subset).
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a kappa 
restricted B cell lymphoma. Correlation with clinical, 
morphologic (see separate pathology report ___ and 
cytogenetics (see separate reports ___-___) findings is 
recommended for further characterization. Flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to 
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

IMAGING:
==========
___ TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild 
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). [Intrinsic 
function may be more depressed given the severity of mitral 
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe 
mitral regurgitation. Normal left ventricular cavity size with 
mild global hypokinesis.

CXR ___:
Mild cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema.  Small right 
pleural effusion.

CXR ___:
Decreased, small, bilateral pleural effusions with improved 
bibasilar atelectasis. 

CXR ___:
Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Increased, but small, 
bilateral pleural effusions.

Exercise stress echo ___:
The patient exercised for 7 minutes and 0 seconds according to a 
Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 102 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 134/60 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of a hypotensive response. This level of 
exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age and 
gender. The exercise ECG was uninterpretable due to resting ST-T 
wave changes (see exercise report for details). The blood 
pressure response to stress was abnormal/hypotensive. There was 
a blunted heart rate response to stress. 

Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 82 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 134/70 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The remaining segments 
contracted well (LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular free wall 
motion is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler 
demonstrated moderate aortic stenonsis, mild aortic 
regurgitation and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, and 
no resting LVOT gradient. .

Echo images were acquired within 53 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 105 - 97 bpm. These demonstrated no new regional 
wall motion abnormalities. Baseline abnormalities persist with 
appropriate augmentation of other segments. 

IMPRESSION: poor functional exercise capacity. uninterpretable 
ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of prior 
myocardial infarction without inducible ischemia to achieved 
workload.","Cough, Fever",3.0,97.0,84.0,18.0,74.0,159.0,98.7,3,30363836,ED,Emergency Department,2141-06-05 04:03:00,2141-06-05 05:30:24

ECHO ___
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional 
systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Well seated, normal functioning aortic valve 
bioprosthesis with normal gradient and no aortic regurgitation. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function has 
improved, the left ventricular apex is no longer aneurysmal, and 
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased with 
similar estimated PA systolic pressure.  

ECHO ___
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. LV systolic function appears overall 
moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF = 30%) secondary to 
extensive apical akinesis with focal apical dyskinesis. Anterior 
septum and anterior free wall are hypokinetic at midventricular 
level as well. The basal segments are hyperdynamic. Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall 
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. A bioprosthetic 
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of asthma,
diabetes, hypertension and vision impairment (legally blind)
presenting with dyspnea and wheezing for 1 day. 

Ms. ___ reports that she has had intermittent symptoms of
worsening asthma over the last 2 months (triggered following a
cold, reportedly) for which she has needed increased rescue
medications. She reports that her symptoms were ok when she saw
her PCP last week however worsened on ___, with
worsening wheezing, shortness of breath and non-productive 
cough.
She is baseline on Advair and albuterol which she was taking
regularly (every few hours) but was running out, prompting her 
to
come to the ED for evaluation. She reports she has had no recent
fevers, chills or productive cough. She denies rhinorrhea or
congestion. She does note that her husband had a ""bug"" the last
few days (URI symptoms and ? fever) though notes they were
sleeping in different rooms so she wouldn't catch it. She has no
new environmental exposures. Her symptoms were also accompanied
by associated chest tightness and nausea. She has had no
vomiting, fevers, chills. No abdominal pain or diarrhea. Given
worsening SOB, she presented to the ED via ambulance for
evaluation. 

In the ambulance, she received nebs x2. 

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals: 97.2, ___, 22 and
97% on 6L NC. Her exam was notable for tachypnea and diffuse
expiratory wheezes with moderate aeration throughout. 
Labs were largely unremarkable with negative trop x1, no
leukocytosis, Cr 1.1. Her VBG was notable for CO2 of 50 in
setting of tachypnea.
CXR on my read showed mild hyperinflation without evidence of
consolidation or other acute abnormalities.
She was given pred 60mg x1, magnesium sulfate IV, 1L LR and
duonebs x1. 
Given ongoing significant wheezing and RA oxygen saturation of
88-90%, decision was made to admit to medicine for further
evaluation and treatment. 
Peak flow prior to departure from ED: 250

On my evaluation of the patient in the ED, she reported feeling
much better though still some SOB. She was on oxygen (2L) at the
time.

Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably 
normal (LVEF>55%). There is considerable beat-to-beat 
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an 
irregular rhythm. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed (mildly?) free wall 
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is 
present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.

================
___ CXR
Comparison to ___.  Stable low lung volumes.  Stable 
moderate cardiomegaly with mild elongation of the descending 
aorta.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No 
pneumonia.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.

___ CXR 
FINDINGS: 
An endotracheal tube tip projects 3.0 cm superior to the carina. 
 Low lung volumes result in crowding of the bronchovascular 
structures and accentuation of heart size.  There is mild 
atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The costophrenic 
angles are excluded from the field of view. Heart size is 
moderately enlarged.  There is mild aortic arch calcification.  
The mediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  A soft 
tissue anchor projects over the right humeral head.
IMPRESSION:  An endotracheal tube tip projects 3.0 cm superior 
to the carina.

___ EGD 
-Large semi-circumferential ulcer was seen at the GE junction 
consistent with post-RFA ulcer. An adherent clot was seen. After 
irrigation and suction, friable mucosa was identified. There was 
spontaneous oozing in setting of contact from the scope 
-Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis. 
-Normal mucosa in the whole examined duodenum. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- ___ extubate patient from GI standpoint. 
- Continue high dose PPI BID. 
- Once extubated and no bleeding overnight, may advance diet as 
tolerated. 
- If safe from cardiovascular standpoint, as per primary team, 
holding Xarelto for next 5 days will decrease risk of bleeding, 
duration of holding Xarelto after discussing with primary 
team/cardiologist.","Dizziness, Melena",1.0,98.0,78.0,18.0,48.0,81.0,96.7,0,35174812,discharge,UNKNOWN,2171-11-27 17:37:06,

IMAGING:
======================
CXR ___. Moderate pulmonary edema, mild to moderate cardiomegaly, 
small pleural 
effusions and and left atrial enlargement.  Pneumonia is not 
excluded. 
2. Severe compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body, 
chronicity 
indeterminate. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. 
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. 
Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 33 %. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of 
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve VTI 
= 55 cm. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
<1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate (___) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
 1) Severe aortic stenosis in setting of low-flow, low-gradient 
hemodynamic conditions due to low LVEF and also LVEDV causing 
area gradient mismatch. 
 2) Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction with regionalities 
c/w diffuse cardiomyopathic process.  

CHEST XRAY ___
Interval decrease in extent of the right infrahilar and 
retrocardiac 
opacities. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present as well 
as 
ill-defined predominantly perihilar opacities likely reflective 
of an element of mild pulmonary edema.. There is no 
pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within 
normal limits. Degenerative changes are noted around both 
shoulders. 

RENAL ULTRASOUND ___. 6.7 cm mass within the right interpolar region without 
internal vascularity is incompletely characterized and should be 
further evaluated with an MR. 
2. 5.8 cm cystic lesion in the right upper pole with thin 
internal septations also noted. 
3. Multiple shadowing echogenic foci within the right kidney 
collecting system suggestive of nonobstructing stones measuring 
up to 1.4 cm. 
  
CHEST XRAY ___
In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken 
a better 
inspiration.  Progressive decrease in the areas opacification 
the at the bases and the left perihilar region.

IMAGING/PROCEDURES
==================
CHEST X RAY (___)
FINDINGS: 
 
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
Opacity seen in the left lower lobe which may represent 
atelectasis or
developing pneumonia.  A Port-A-Cath is seen along the right 
anterior chest
wall with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  There is no 
effusion, or
pneumothorax.  There are no signs of congestion or edema.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous 
structures are intact. 
Surgical anchors are noted in the right humeral head.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Left lower lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis or 
developing
pneumonia.

TTE (___)
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
mid-distal inferolateral, anterolateral, and anterior walls (see 
schematic). The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is 45-50%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. No ventricular septal
defect is seen. Diastolic parameters are indeterminate. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The 
aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending 
aorta diameter for gender. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There 
is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
[1+]
mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis 
of the mid-distal inferolateral, anterolateral, and anterior 
walls consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease. Mild 
mitral regurgitation. Normal pulmonary pressure.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION (___)
Coronary Description
The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel and is normal. This vessel trifurcates into the 
Left Anterior Descending, Left Circumflex, and Ramus 
Intermedius.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 50% tubular stenosis 
in the proximal segment. There is a 30% diffuse stenosis in the 
mid segment. The Septal Perforator, arising from the proximal 
segment, is a small caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel with mild luminal irregularities. The ___ Obtuse 
Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, is a medium caliber 
vessel. There is a 70% stenosis in the ostium. The ___ Obtuse 
Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber 
vessel.
RI: The Ramus Intermedius, which arises from the LM, is a medium 
caliber vessel. There is a 100% stenosis in the proximal 
segment. There are collaterals from the distal RCA.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 95% stenosis in the proximal 
and mid segments. There is a 95% stenosis in the mid and distal 
segments. The Acute Marginal, arising from the proximal segment, 
is a small caliber vessel. The Right Posterior Descending 
Artery, arising from the distal segment, is a medium caliber 
vessel. The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.

Interventional Details
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad hoc basis based on the 
coronary angiographic findings from the diagnostic portion of 
this procedure. A ___ AL 0.75 guiding catheter provided excellent 
support. After crossing with a wire all stenoses were dilated 
using a 2.0 mm NC balloon. Unsuccessful attempt to pass a 2.5mm 
x 38mm stent, so did further dilations using a 2.5mm NC balloon 
at high pressure. The balloon at this point became stuck to the 
wire
and pulled wire out of vessel as removed. Tried unsuccessfully 
to recross all stenoses using a Sion wire and then a Prowater 
wire but unsuccessful because of passage into dissection flaps.. 
Since there is only mild stenosis (approx 40%) and normal flow 
and patient free of chest pain, decided that risks outweigh 
benefits of more aggressive attempts.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.

Findings
 Three vessel coronary artery disease.
 PTCA alone (POBA) of RCA.
