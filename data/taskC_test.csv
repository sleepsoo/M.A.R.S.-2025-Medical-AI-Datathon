medium caliber vessel. There is a 90%
stenosis in the ostium. There is a stent in the proximal and mid 
segments.
The Inferior lateral of the OM, arising from the proximal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel. There is a
60% stenosis in the proximal and mid segments.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. There is a 30%
stenosis in the proximal segment. There is a stent in the 
proximal segment. There is a stent in the mid
and distal segments. There is a stent in the distal segment.
The Right Posterior Descending Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
The Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Interventional Details
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) was performed on an ad
hoc basis based on the coronary angiographic findings from the 
diagnostic portion of this procedure. A 6
___ EBU3.75 guide provided adequate support. Crossed with a 
Prowater wire into the distal OM. We
also placed a Sion blue wire in the AV groove branch to protect 
this branch Predilated with a 2.5 mm
balloon and then deployed a 3.5 mm x 24 mm DES, extending from 
the proximal LCx into the OM1
branch. We pulled the wire out of the AV groove branch, flow 
remained intact in this branch. Postdilated
with a 3.5 mm balloon, 18 ATM in the distal stent and 20 ATM in 
the proximal stent. (this stent
overlapped distally with the prior 3.0 DES placed in the mid OM1 
branch in ___ Final angiography
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications.

IMAGING:
=======

___ TEE: 
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the 
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection 
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect or patent 
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast 
with maneuvers. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
mildly depressed. The ascending, transverse and descending 
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of 
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No ___ SEC or thrombus. No ASD/PFO. No 
source of embolism identified. 

ECHO (___): 
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence for cardiac souce of 
embolus identified. The patient appears to be ventricularly 
paced. There is no atrial activity arguing for either sinus 
nodal arrest or atrial fibrillation as underlying 
supraventricular rhythm. Mild global left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. There is a non-cardiac structure compression the ___ 
___ which may be a hiatal hernia. If clinically indicated 
a chest CT could identify this structure further. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
no significant change.  

CXR (___):
No evidence of rib fracture. Pacemaker and ICD leads are 
unchanged in
position.

CT A/P (___):
Several low-attenuation regions in the left kidney, the largest 
of which involve the lower pole and measures approximately 4.3 x 
2.7 x 3.1cm. No definite capsular enhancement is seen, however, 
findings raise concern for multiple renal infarcts versus 
pyelonephritis. Perinephric stranding, particularly inferiorly. 
Of note, patient urinalysis does not indicate infection. The 
patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation which raises 
concern for renal infarct. Further characterization could be 
obtained with MRI. If not obtained, recommend follow-up in one 
month to exclude underlying mass.
Indeterminate 8 mm hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver 
could be further assessed with ultrasound or MRI on a non 
emergent basis.

Chest XRay ___
Dense left basilar opacity, potentially due to component of 
effusion although  superimposed consolidation is likely.  
Followup after treatment is suggested to document resolution. 

EKG ___:  125, sinus, PR depressions, no ST elevations

TTE ___
Focused study to rule out tamponade.

 The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is abnormal septal 
motion/position. The mitral valve appears structurally normal 
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is a small sized pericardial effusion. The 
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, 
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M with HTN, HLD, presumed
mesenteric vasculitis, presenting with right leg pain, dyspnea,
and tachycardia. found to have new multivessel RLE DVT and
bilateral pulmonary emboli.

Patient first noted the right leg pain ___ night. The pain
initially started as cramps, but then despite resting the leg
began to worsen. It began in his calf, but then progressed to 
his
foot. He could not tolerate placing any weight on it. He woke up
___ morning, and continued to have significant pain with
inability to tolerate weight. Despite using OTC analgesic
medications, he found no relief. On ___ his pain had improved
slightly, but was still severe, prompting him to reach out to 
his
PCP. An ultrasound was scheduled for today, which noted acute
DVTs found in 2 gastroc veins, 2 peroneal veins, and posterior
tibial vein. He was instructed to take apixaban this morning. On
further discussion with the patient, he noted significant
fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath with exertion. On
review of records at his last clinic appointment, he was also
noted to be tachycardic. Given this, there was significant
concern for PE, prompting him to be referred to the ED for
further evaluation.         

Of note, the patient completed a 6 month course of apixaban 1
month ago for his SMA thrombus that was diagnosed in ___. 

- ED Course notable for:
     - Patient underwent CTA, and was found to have pulmonary
emboli. He was started on heparin IV.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ female who presents to ___ on
___ with a mild TBI. The patient fell down 1 flight of
stairs with head strike and LOC.  She does not remember the fall
or circumstances leading up to it.  CT at ___ showed left
parietal/temporal SAH with extension to perimesencephalic area
and she was transported to ___ for Neurosurgical evaluation
===============
MEDICINE HPI 
In brief, this patient is an ___ year old woman with a history of 
COPD, congestive heart failure, meningioma s/p resection, 
diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, prior pericardial effusion, GI 
bleed, who was admitted to the neurosurgical service after 
presenting ___ following an unwitessed fall down a flight of 
stairs, with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Patient was found at the bottom of one flight of stairs by her 
daughter, unconscious. Patient does not recall the events prior 
to her fall, unsure if she had syncope. No prior history of 
syncope, although sh enotes some dizziness intermittently for 
the past month. After regaining consciousness at home, she had 
about 5 minutes of confusion.
She was initially taken to ___, where she had normal 
FAST/CXR/EKG/CT torso. CT head and CT spine showed left 
parietal/temporal SAH with extension to the perimesencephalic 
area, for which she was transferred to ___ for neurosurgical 
evaluation. Repeat CTA at ___ was negative for aneurysm, and 
noted that her intracranial hemorrhages were stable. She has 
been neurologically intact, GCS 15, and oriented x2-3, which per 
her daughter is the patient's baseline.
She was initially admitted to neuro step-down unit. Due to her 
chronic medical issues, ___ transfer was initiated. On 
evaluation by MERIT, she was on supplement oxygen (not on 
supplemental O2 at home), but this has since been weaned off. At 
baseline, she is significantly short of breath with exertion, 
such as bending over to put on shoes/socks, or walking even 1 
block on flat ground. However, per patient and her daughters, 
her exertional dyspnea has been stable and not recently worse, 
attributed to COPD primarily, for which she is only on Xopenex 
nebs at home . She is compliant with her CPAP for OSA (daughter 
shoes picture on her phone of Respironics machine, set at 9cm 
H20 CPAP. She reported mild chronic ankle swelling (no worse 
than usual) denies significant change in weight. She has no 
current dyspnea, chest pain/tightness/pressure, wheezing, cough, 
sputum production, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, urinary complaints.
She has been constipated for the past month, using OTC laxatives 
at home.
Her current complaint is of generalized pain. She has pain at 
the base of the thumbs; notes chronic pain in these regions, but 
worse since her fall. XRays demonstrated severe CMC arthritis, 
no fractures. She also has pain on the left side of her neck. 
Her headache has resolved.
Her daughters are also concerned that she has been mildly 
confused. At baseline she has mild cognitive deficits, per 
daughters she easily ""loses her train of thought"" or forgets why 
she was doing something, occasionally forgets the date, but is 
otherwise well oriented. She lives with her daughter, but is 
independent in basic ADLs. In the hospital she has been more 
confused, not sure what is going on, ""making up stories,"" and 
disoriented.

mm rightward shift of normally midline structures.

___ PCXR
IMPRESSION:
Improved aeration of the bilateral lower lobes.

___ PCXR
IMPRESSION:

___ EEG
IMPRESSION:
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The 
background was disorganized and slow, with ___ Hz maximum 
frequencies in any given area and with some bursts of 
generalized slowing. This finding is indicative of a moderate 
encephalopathy that is nonspecific with regard to etiology but 
can be seen with toxic metabolic disturbances or infections. 
There were no focal abnormalities, definite epileptiform 
discharges, or electrographic seizures.

___ EEG
IMPRESSION:
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations, it showed a 
slow and disorganized background with some bursts of generalized 
delta slowing. these findings indicate a moderate to severe 
encephalopathy. There were no clear focal abnormalities, but 
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no 
clearly epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. 
Compared to prior day's recording, there was no significant 
change.

___ CXR
In comparison ___, cardiomegaly is accompanied by 
pulmonary 
vascular congestion.  Bibasilar atelectasis has worsened on the

short segmental dissections of the infrarenal abdominal aorta 
and R common iliac artery. Labs were notable for leukocytosis 
27.6, Hgb low at 8.9 (10.4 on ___, and platelets low at 62.1 
(546 on ___. Troponin was elevated to 0.13, with flat MB. Blood 
pressures were as low as 85/26. Left femoral CVL and A-lines 
were placed, and the patient was started on norepinephrine. 
Bedside TTE revealed no frank RV strain or new WMA. He was 
started on heparin gtt for possible ACS leading to V-fib and 
decision was made to admit to CCU for further monitoring and 
plan for cath in the morning.

TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----   <=1 S

IMAGES:
=======
CT Head (___):
No acute intracranial abnormality. 
  
CT Torso (___):
1. 3.3 cm suprahilar right upper lobe lung mass with multiple 
rim enhancing lesions throughout the liver, compatible with 
metastatic lung cancer. 
2. No evidence of large central pulmonary embolism, but 
assessment of the segmental and subsegmental levels is limited 
by timing of the contrast bolus. 
3. Endotracheal tube positioned at the level of the carina.  
Recommend withdrawing 3-5 cm for more optimal positioning. 
4. Short segmental dissections in the infrarenal abdominal aorta 
and right common iliac artery.  No thoracic aortic dissection. 
5. Large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive bilateral 
lower lobe atelectasis. 
6. Minimally displaced right anterolateral fifth and sixth rib 
fracture likely related to recent resuscitation. 
7. Nodular, heterogeneously enhancing thyroid likely reflective 
multinodular thyroid goiter. 
8. Large right hydrocele, incompletely imaged. 
  
TTE (___):
Suboptimal image quality. Global left ventricular hypokinesis 
with regional left ventricular variation c/w CAD . Marked 
thickening and calcification of valvular structures and 
aorto-mitral continuity c/w h/o chest radiation. At least mild 
to moderate aortic stenosis. Moderate eccentric aortic 
regurgitation. Functional mitral stenosis. Pulmonary 
hypertension.  

CXR (___):
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, mildly improved on the 
right.  Basilar consolidations, likely atelectasis.  Pulmonary 
vascular congestion. 

CXR (___):
Persisting small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions as well 
as pulmonary vascular congestion. Abnormal density in the right 
suprahilar region, better characterized on the CT dated ___. 

TTE (___):
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Moderate regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Aortic stenosis, not quantified. 
Moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. At 
least mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, comparable findings are similar. 
 

MIBI (___):
1. Partially reversible, moderate to severe perfusion defect in 
the 
inferior wall associated with akinesis is compatible with right 
coronary artery disease. 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction 
63%. 

PATHOLOGY:
==========
Liver lesion, targeted needle core biopsy:
- Metastatic carcinoma with glandular and squamous 
differentiation. See note. Note: The tumor demonstrates both 
overt glandular and squamous differentiation on H&E. 
Immunohistochemical and special staining supports this 
morphological diagnosis with immunoreactivity demonstrated for 
P40, CK7, and CK19, and strongly positive staining for 
mucicarmine. Negative stains include TTF1, Napsin, CK20 and 
CDX2. These findings are not specific as to site of origin, but 
raise the possibility of a primary adenosquamous carcinoma of 
the lung or pancreas, as well as salivary gland-type 
mucoepidermoid carcinoma, . Further correlation with imaging is 
needed to distinguish between these (and other)
possible sites of origin.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because
of diffuse slowing indicative of a mild-moderate encephalopathy. 
Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common 
causes.
Attenuation of background activity over the left hemisphere, 
maximal in the
frontocentral region, is indicative of an intervening fluid 
collection and
consistent with the known subdural hematoma in this region. 
Focal slowing over
the left hemisphere is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction 
in this
region. Occasional left temporal sharp waves are indicative of 
cortical
irritability in this region. There are no definite epileptiform 
discharges or
electrographic seizures.

___ CT head
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Overall stable 19 mm left frontal parietal extra-axial 
collection likely
representing a subdural hematoma with 4 mm of midline shift and 
crowding of
the suprasellar cistern.
2. No definite new area of hemorrhage.
3. Slight increased prominence of left periventricular white 
matter
hypodensities may be due to edema or evolving infarction.

___ ___
IMPRESSION: 
 
Findings concerning for right peroneal vein deep venous 
thrombosis.  No
evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the more proximal right 
lower extremity.
 
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the leftlower extremity 
veins.

___ CT head

IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Evolving postsurgical changes related to recent left frontal 
craniotomy and
subdural hemorrhage evacuation with interval removal of 
previously noted
subdural drain.
2. Left frontoparietal 0.9 cm acute on subacute subdural 
hemorrhage, decreased
in size from ___ prior exam.
3. No definite new or worsening intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Grossly stable 3 mm rightward midline shift.
5. Grossly stable nonspecific periventricular findings, which 
may represent
microangiopathic changes, with differential considerations of 
edema.
6. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the 
detection of acute
infarct.

IMAGING STUDIES:
================
CXR (___): No acute intrathoracic process.  Calcified density 
projecting over the left scapular neck, correlate for focal 
pain. 

TTE ___ left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
2) Sinus rhythm with AV dissociation due to complete heart block 
and broad QRS escape. Compared with the prior study (images 
reviewed) of ___, there now is complete heart block.  

CXR (___):   
In comparison with the study of ___, there has been 
placement of a left subclavian dual channel pacer with leads 
extending to the right atrium and right ventricle.  No evidence 
of post procedure pneumothorax. 
No change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. The 
calcified ovoid density projected over the neck of the left 
scapula is somewhat obscured by the overlying pacer leads. 

___
CXR
IMPRESSION:  
  
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Pacemaker leads 
terminate in right 
atrium and right ventricle.  Vascular congestion is moderate.  
Bibasal 
opacities might represent part of vascular 
congestion/interstitial edema but also might represent 
developing infection, attention on the subsequent study is 
recommended to this area. 
  
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are most 
consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized pericardial 
effusion. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There 
is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with 
impaired filling/tamponade physiology. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Small to moderately sized serous pericardial effusion largely 
located anterior to the apex of the RV. There is brief RA and 
very subtle diastolic RV collapse suggestive of mild tamponade 
physiology however there is no variation in mitral inflow 
pattern. Pericardial tamponade is a clinical diagnosis and 
echocardiographic signs are ancillary to this diagnosis.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with H/O hypercholesterolemia 
and no CAD on coronary angiography in ___ presenting with 
chest pain.

She reports that she had an episode of neck tightness the 
morning prior to admission which occurred while sitting. This 
resolved after about 5 minutes on it's own. She thought this was 
related to atorvastatin because she had just restarted this 
medication that same morning but she denied rash, pruritus or 
tongue swelling. Later that evening around 11 pm, she developed 
left sided sharp chest pain which radiated to her left arm. Pain 
was associated with nausea and palpitations, but not 
diaphoresis. The pain comes on at rest and with exertion. She 
had intermittent episodes of sharp chest pain overnight so she 
went to see her PCP the next day. At her PCP's office, she 
received full dose ASA and nitroglycerin which improved her 
symptoms. ECG was notable for new LBBB from ___ in PCP's 
office. She was then referred to the ___ ED.

In the ED initial vitals were T 98.1 HR 65 BP 118/75 RR 16 SaO2 
100% on RA. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 71 pm with a LBBB and 
normal axis. Labs notable for Troponin-T <0.01, Cr 0.9, Na 140, 
WBC 6.1, Hgb/Hct 11.9/35.5. CXR was without acute 
cardiopulmonary process. Patient was given citalopram 40 mg po, 
clonazepam 0.5 mg po, omeprazole 40 mg po, and bupropion XL 
300mg po in the ED. Cardiology recommended admission for 
evaluation of unstable angina. Vitals on transfer: HR 79 BP 
107/58 RR 18 SaO2 100% on RA.

On arrival to the cardiology ward, patient reported that she was 
chest pain free.

Exercise stress nuclear test ___
This ___ year old woman with a history of HL, LBBB and familiar 
premature CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest 
discomfort following negative serial cardiac markers. The 
patient exercised for 10.5 minutes of a Gervino protocol and 
stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 5.5 
which represents a fair functional capacity for her age. No arm, 
neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient 
throughout the study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for 
ischemia in the setting of the baseline LBBB. The rhythm was 
sinus with one apb. Appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise 
and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST 
segments in setting of LBBB.
IMAGING: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft 
tissue and breast attenuation.
  Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
  Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a predominantly 
fixed, mild reduction in photon counts involving the mid 
anteroseptum, distal anterior wall, and the apex.  Gated images 
reveal normal wall motion.
  The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with 
an EDV of 72 ml.
IMPRESSION:   
1. Probably normal myocardial perfusion. Predominantly fixed 
anterior and septal defect most consistent with breast 
attenuation and/or LBBB.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.

STUDIES
=======
CT A/P with Contrast ___
1. Post hysterectomy without definite CT evidence of local 
recurrence. No 
abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy or distal metastasis. 
2. Bilateral adrenal nodules demonstrate CT characteristics most 
compatible with adenomas. 
3. Mild ectasia (1.9 cm) of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. 
4. Please refer to the separate chest CT dictation regarding 
intrathoracic 
findings.

CT Chest with Contrast ___
1. 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is 
highly 
concerning for malignancy.  Differentials include primary lung 
cancer given solitary nature, versus metastatic disease from 
known prior gynecologic malignancy. 
2. Additional nonspecific 0.4 cm nodule in the right upper lobe 
warrants 
attention on follow-up imaging. 

MR ___ ___
1.  Study is moderately degraded by motion. 
2. Numerous supratentorial and infratentorial heterogeneously 
enhancing 
parenchymal based lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema.  
Findings are most compatible with metastatic disease. 
3. Associated mild local mass effect is seen with minimal 
effacement of the left lateral and fourth ventricles, in 
addition to 2-3 mm of rightward midline shift. 
4. No evidence for vascular territorial infarction or acute 
intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
5. A heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the inferior right 
cerebellar 
hemisphere contacts the adjacent sigmoid sinus, which appears to 
remain 
patent.  However, subtle invasion of the sinus is not excluded. 

Lung Biopsy ___
Technically successful CT-guided biopsy of right upper lobe lung 
mass.  3 
samples (10 mm 18 gauge cores) were submitted for pathology in 2 
separate 
formalin containers.  No immediate postprocedure complication. 

PATHOLOGY
=========

IMAGING
=============
___ MRI HEAD W & WO CONTRAST
1. Please note, due to contrast infiltration, very minimal 
amount of contrast was administered into the patient, 
significantly limiting evaluation for enhancing lesions.  The 
exam is essentially noncontrast enhanced. 
2. Large hemorrhagic lesion within the right cerebellar 
hemisphere measuring 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm, with surrounding 
vasogenic edema associated with mass effect on the right aspect 
of the brainstem, fourth ventricle, with presence an ascending 
transtentorial herniation. 
3. There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle and cerebral 
aqueduct.  Close attention for developing hydrocephalus is 
recommended. 
4. Although there is no definite evidence of an additional 
lesion based solely on edema, possibility of additional 
enhancing lesion is not entirely excluded. 
A repeat contrast-enhanced study is recommended. 
5. Age-related diffuse parenchymal volume loss with probable 
chronic small 
vessel microangiopathy. 
6. Reported 2 ml of contrast extravasation within the left 
antecubital fossa.  Recommend reassessment on clinical 
examination for increased soft tissue swelling, erythema, 
paresthesia or other clinical symptoms that would warrant 
possible surgical consultation. 
  
___ CT CHEST 
-------------------
1. Diffuse pulmonary nodules with mediastinal and hilar 
adenopathy, some of which are centrally hypodense to suggest 
necrosis, consistent with widespread metastatic disease. 
2.  Pulmonary emboli involve bibasilar segmental and 
subsegmental pulmonary arteries, right more extensive than left. 
 
3. Small nonhemorrhagic and layering left pleural effusion.  
4. For complete subdiaphragmatic findings, please refer to CT 
abdomen and 
pelvis performed on the same date, ___, clip number 
___. 

___ CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS
1. A 3.2 cm hyperattenuating lesion in the upper pole of the 
left kidney is consistent with known renal cell carcinoma. 
2. Multiple enlarged lymph lymph nodes and lymph node 
conglomerates in the 
gastrohepatic, periportal, portacaval, and periaortic region.  
The largest 
lymph node conglomerate is located in the left periaortic region 
measuring up to 5.3 cm. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 4:45 ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Expected postoperative changes from resection of a right 
cerebellar mass with persistent surrounding vasogenic edema and 
mild effacement of the fourth ventricle without evidence of 
hydrocephalus. 
2. No acute large territorial infarct. 

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 3:46 AM 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post resection of a right cerebellar mass with 
postoperative changes and suggestion of postoperative ischemia 
along the resection cavity. 
2. No definite solid nodularity or abnormal enhancement to 
suggest residual disease. 
3. Decrease in mass effect on the brainstem and fourth 
ventricle. 
4. Postoperative changes without other intracranial hemorrhage 
or large 
territorial infarction. 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ___
Again, patient is post right occipital craniectomy for right 
cerebellar mass resection.  Expected postsurgical air and 
hyperdense blood products again noted at the site of resection.  
No new evidence of new intracranial 
hemorrhage.  No large territorial infarction is detected.  
Periventricular 
white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, but likely sequela 
of chronic 
small vessel ischemic disease.  Ventricles and sulci are stable 
in size and configuration, including prominence of the third 
ventricle.  There is no shift of normally midline structures.  
Basal cisterns remain patent. 
  
The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air 
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized 
portion of the orbits are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  No new hemorrhage detected.  No interval change since the CT 
head from the prior day. 
  
2.  Postsurgical changes in the right cerebellar resection 
cavity are similar to before.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with no significant medical 
history who presents with a 50 pound weight loss, night sweats, 
shortness of breath, dry cough and intermittent rash over the 
past six months. 

In terms of the course of her illness, the first change she 
noted was that her pants were not fitting the way they used to 
in ___, and saw at that point that she was 175 pounds, though 
she is normally 180 pounds, and did not think anything of the 
small change. The weight loss has continued and she is currently 
128 pounds. The next change she noticed in ___ was that she was 
having night sweats every night, and also developed an itchy, 
coalescing rash with a rough surface on her back at the same 
time. She initially thought the night sweats were due to the hot 
weather, but they have persisted into the present. In 
___, she also developed shortness of breath that 
occurs only with exertion, and never at rest. In ___, she 
also developed a dry cough, and another rash on her stomach, 
that was similar to the rash on her back.

She was evaluated by her PCP, who sent some labs, significant 
for elevated ESR, and sent her for abdominal U/S and CXR, which 
were significant for mild cardiomegaly, and then sent her for an 
ECHO, which was significant for pericardial effusion. She was 
then transferred to the ___ cardiology service, who repeated 
ECHO, found a small pericardial effusion and no signs of cardiac 
tamponade. Given lack of more systemic findings, transferred her 
to medicine. 

When she was transferred to ___, she was alert and oriented, in 
no acute distress and stable vitals. 

In the ED, initial vitals were:
Temp 98.9 HR 93 BP 112/75 RR 16 SpO2 98% RA 
CBC showed WBC 4.2, Hg 9, platelets 185. Chem-7 Na 136, K 3.7, 
Cl 101, Bicarb 25, BUN 7, Cr 0.5. ALT 62, AST 157, LDH 1180, 
Albumin 3.4. INR 1.2
Pulsus paradoxus ___

EKG NSR 93, NL axis, NI, no alterans

CXR Showed mild cardiomegaly. No radiographic evidence of 
mediastinal  adenopathy.

Bedside echo showed moderate effusion, mild RV diastolic 
anterior wall bowing. Cardiology consulted and on their exam 
found to have pulsus ___. Bedside TTE showed apical/posterior 
moderate pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. 
Recommended getting TTE images from ___, serial pulsus 
checks, consideration of repeat TTE in AM, and work up for 
weight loss.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, lymphadenopathy, 
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. All of the other review 
of systems were negative.  
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PERTINENT IMAGING:
======================
CT Chest (___): Mild pericardial effusion without CT 
evidence of cardiac tamponade. Extensive bilateral 
lymphadenopathy and right lower paratracheal lymph node. The 
differential includes both malignant adenopathy including 
lymphoma and benign disease such as collagen vascular or mixed 
connective disorders. Atypical infection is favored less likely 
given the absence of parenchymal findings. 
===
CT ABD/TORSO (___):
1. Mild periaortic and left external iliac lymphadenopathy 
measuring up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm, finidngs are non-specific and can 
be seen in a systemic inflammatory process, such as collagen 
vascular disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosous), or 
rheumatiod arthritis,  the appearance is atypical for lymphoma 
although this cannot be entirely excluded. 
2. Small fat containing umbilical hernia. 
===
TTE (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
===
Lumbosacral Plain Films (___): Normal lumbar spine x-ray 
examination.
===
Left Hip Plain Film (___): Normal pelvis and left hip 
radiographs.
===
Left Knee Plain Film (___): Normal right knee x-ray 
examination.
===
MRI Left Knee With and Without Contrast (___):
1. No abnormal focal bone marrow edema identified.  No evidence 
of fracture, osteonecrosis, bone erosion, or focal bony lesion. 
2. Mild degenerative change in the distal quadriceps tendon.  
Otherwise, no gross tendinous or ligamentous abnormality. 
3. No obvious mensical tear (please see comment). 
4. Small amount of joint fluid with trace synovial thickening 
and enhancement could reflect mild synovitis. However, the 
appearance is likely accentuated due to technical limitation of 
imaging later than usual after IV contrast administration .  
additional trace fluid in the infrapatellar bursa, though this 
does not meet criteria for bursitis.
5. Nonspecific superolateral ___ fat pad edema and 
enhancement.  In the appropriate clinical setting, lateral 
femoral condyle- patellar tendon friction syndrome is a 
consideration. 
6. Mild degenerative change of the distal quadriceps tendon. 
7. Several nonenlarged popliteal lymph nodes, together with mild 
joint fluid. Though these findings are very subtle and also 
nonspecific, but could reflect mild inflammatory change.  The 
differential diagnosis could also include mild changes of Lyme 
disease. 
===
MRI Pelvis With and Without Contrast (___):
1. Irregular 3.8 x 2.5 x 3.1 cm rim enhancing fluid collection 
in the left 
groin with surrounding soft tissue edema, concerning for abscess 
in the site of recent prior lymph node biopsy. 
2. Patchy edema and enhancement of the bilateral iliopsoas, 
piriformis and obturator internus musculature compatible with 
nonspecific myositis.  Trace edema also seen in the quadratus 
femoris muscles.  Myositis can be a feature of sarcoidosis, 
though the pattern is typically different from this. 
3. Mild edema at the abductor insertions bilaterally trauma.  
While this is often seen in the setting of a muscle strain, in 
this setting, it could be related to the more generalized 
myositis. 
4. Bilateral pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy, unchanged from the 
___ CT examination. 
5. 1.6 cm rounded T1 hyperintense right adnexal lesion is 
incompletely characterized, probably representing a small 
hemorrhagic cyst. 
6. No focal bony lesion detected. 
7. Left hip and proximal femur within normal limits.  No marrow 
edema to suggest fracture osteonecrosis.  No joint effusion. 
===
TTE (___): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, 
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate sized 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. There is an intrapericardial mass (approx 2.0 x 3.0 
cm) adherent to the cardiac apex along the interventricular 
groove. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 
___, the pericardial effusion appears slightly larger. The 
apical intrapericardial mass is better visualized. If indicated, 
a cardiac MRI or CT may better assess the mass. 
===
Cardiac MRI (___): Moderate pericardial effusion with 
prominent epicardial fat pad. Normal biventricular cavity sizes 
and preserved systolic function. Epicardial late gadolinium 
enhancement in a non-specific pattern. The CMR findings are not 
suggestive of myocarditis or intracardiac/pericardial mass. The 
prior echo findings best correlate with prominent epicardial 
fat.
===
PET CT (___): 
1.  Diffuse increased FDG avidity is seen involving the 
cervical, axillary, hilar, mediastinal, supraclavicular, 
retroperitoneal, pelvic, and external iliac lymph nodes, as 
described in detail above. 
2. Moderate pericardial effusion, not significantly changed 
compared to the prior MRI from ___. 
===
EMG (___): Essentially normal study. There is no 
electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized myopathy, 
including myopathy with denervating (""inflammatory"") features. 
===
MRI Bilateral Thigh With and Without Contrast (___): 
Heterogeneously increased edema signal and enhancement in 
multiple muscles in the bilateral thighs.  This is a 
non-specific finding.  The differential diagnosis includes 
non-specific myositis.  Within the thigh, the vastus lateralis 
muscles demonstrate small foci the slightly greater signal 
intensity compared to surrounding muscles. (at the time of the 
___ pelvic CT, the degree of edema in the 
piriformis, iliacus, and obturator internus muscles was also 
relatively more intense.)

PATHOLOGY:
=============
___ Right posterior thigh ulcer edge punch biopsy
- Ulcer with mild inflammation in ulcer bed and deep dermal 
fibrosis and focal fat necrosis.
- Note: There is focal deep dermal hemosiderin deposition 
(confirmed with iron stain). There is deep dermal fibrosis and 
focal fat necrosis at the deep edge of the biopsy. As these 
findings are at the
base of the biopsy, an underlying process such as calciphylaxis 
or a deeper vascular occlusive process cannot be evaluated or 
excluded.

___ Right medial stump punch biopsy
-Superficial specimen - epidermal necrosis, vascular congestion, 
and florid dermal acute
inflammation.
-Deeper fragments (deep dermis and subcutis) - marked necrosis, 
inflammation, and numerous gram
positive bacterial cocci, see note.
- Note: Gram stain is positive for numerous gram positive cocci 
(some in clusters). PAS and GMS are
negative for fungi. ___ and AFB are negative for mycobacterial 
organisms.

IMAGING
==========
- CXR ___
Small right pleural effusion unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis, 
probably
moderate in both lower lobes, unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly 
stable.  Upper
lungs clear.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads 
unchanged in their
standard positions, probably continuous from the right axillary 
generator, not
fully imaged on this study.  .  Skin staples still present in 
the right
pectoral region.

- ___ ___.  Cholelithiasis and small amount of gallbladder sludge 
without evidence of
cholecystitis.
2.  No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
4.  Limited evaluation of the kidneys demonstrate multiple small 
cysts and
mild atrophy of the right kidney.

-TTE ___
Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular cavity size 
with moderate to severe systolic dysfunction. Well seated 
bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with normal gradient. Mild to 
moderate mitral regurgitation. Well seated bileaflet aortic 
valve prosthesis with normal gradient and no aortic 
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension 
with mild right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation.

- CXR ___
Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer leads are in standard 
position.  There
is mild vascular congestion.  Small to moderate right pleural 
effusion has
increased, bibasilar atelectasis have increased.  There is no 
pneumothorax. 
Sternal wires are aligned.

- RUE Duplex ___: 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. Right basilic vein not seen. Subcutaneous edema. 
  
- CXR ___:
Comparison to ___. The left internal jugular vein 
catheter was removed. The right pectoral pacemaker is in 
unchanged position. Constant alignment of the sternal wires.  No 
pulmonary edema, no pneumonia. Minimal left and right basilar 
atelectasis.  Mild elongation of the descending aorta. 
 
- Duplex ___ upper extremities ___  
No evidence of axillo-sunclavian occlusive disease in either 
upper extremity. 
  
- CTA ___:
1. Severe peripheral vascular disease with occlusion of the left 
common iliac artery and right external iliac artery. 
2. Small left adrenal nodule statistically likely to represent 
an adenoma. 
3. Trace left pleural effusion. 
4. Cholelithiasis. 

- Bone scan ___: 
1.  Reduced tissue clearance of radiotracer in the bilateral 
lower 
extremities, more pronounced on the left, likely reflects 
vascular 
insufficiency; however, calciphylaxis is also possible.  
2.  Focal radiotracer uptake in the left upper thoracic spine 
likely reflects 
degenerative changes.  
3.  Focal radiotracer uptake in the posterior aspect of the left 
ilium in the 
absence of correlative findings on CT is nonspecific.  MRI of 
the pelvis could 
be obtained for further evaluation if clinically indicated. 

- ___ B/L ___
FINDINGS:  
On realtime and color Doppler, both groins and proximal SFA is 
were examined. No arterial flow could be detected.  Findings are 
consistent with a completely occluded common femoral artery, SFA 
and profunda on both sides. 
IMPRESSION:  
Bilaterally occluded and femoral arteries, superficial femoral 
arteries and profunda femoris.

- CT Lower Extremity ___
1. Subcutaneous edema about bilateral lower extremities could 
reflect edema in the setting of third spacing or, alternatively, 
cellulitis.  No drainable fluid collection or subcutaneous gas 
is detected. Small focal area of fluid interspersed with fat in 
the posterior upper right thigh is also not suggestive of a 
immature drainable collection. 
2. Unchanged indeterminate well-circumscribed subcutaneous soft 
tissue nodule in the right buttock measuring 3.3 x 1.6 cm.  If 
clinically indicated, MRI may help for further assessment. 
3. Nonspecific enlarged left popliteal lymph nodes.  Also 
prominent right popliteal lymph nodes not pathologically 
enlarged by CT size criteria. 
4. 2 small areas of fenestration in the distal cortex of the 
left distal femur at the amputation site, unchanged compared 
with ___.  No associated periosteal new bone 
formation or focal fluid collection is detected. Correlation 
with any prior studies may help to assess the acuity of this 
finding.  Otherwise, no focal osteolysis to suggest 
osteomyelitis. 
5. Possible thrombosis of the left  iliac graft (on this study 
seen only in left inguinal region), but similar to the ___ and ___ CTs (where it was imaged more 
extensively).  Is this a known finding?  Clinical correlation is 
requested.  Based on OMR, the the patient is on warfarin. 
6. Small locule of gas in the urinary bladder may be from recent 

instrumentation such as Foley catheter.  Please correlate 
clinically. 
7. Evidence of avascular necrosis in bilateral femoral head 
similar to the prior study. 

TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible vegetation on 
both mitral and aortic valve prosthesis. Image quality does not 
allow to be definite. Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction 
c/w CAD in the LAD distribution. Moderate pulmonary systolic 
arterial hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
echodense stucture on the aortic valve may have been present on 
prior images (clip 3 and 34). The mitral valve was not as well 
visualized on the prior echocardiogram. Review of the TEE images 
from ___, showed a very thick subvalvular mitral apparatus 
which could account for the finding visualized in the current 
study. The aortic valve prosthesis was entirely normal then.  
 
CT ___ ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Moderate fat stranding involving the buttocks and posterior 
proximal thighs bilaterally without evidence for fluid 
collection, suggestive of cellulitis. 
2. No evidence of osteomyelitis. 
3. Unchanged 1.5 x 3.4 cm lobulated cystic lesion within the 
right gluteal subcutaneous region, unchanged, likely an 
epidermal inclusion cyst.  Clinical correlation is recommended, 
and if necessary, ultrasound can be obtained for 
further evaluation. 
4. Avascular necrosis of both femoral heads as seen previously. 
5. Study was performed as a noncontrast examination as the IV 
infiltrated during contrast administration. 

CT CHEST ___
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

basal to mid inferior and inferoseptal walls. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = ___ %). Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are 
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a PMH significant for 
CKD (baseline Cr 2.3), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who 
presents from his cardiologist's office with chest pain and new 
focal wall motion abnormalities on TTE.  

Per the patient, his symptoms started about a week ago. He was 
driving and began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, diaphoretic. He 
drove himself to the ___ ER and was evaluated there. He 
reportedly had two negative troponins and ruled out for ACS. He 
notes that at that time he also experienced some discomfort that 
radiated to his bilateral shoulders.

The patient then went to ___ where he and his wife 
were looking for a new house. He spent three days there. During 
this time he in general felt more weak than usual and fatigued. 
He did not have recurrence of the lightheadedness or dizziness 
and he denies having any chest pain or pressure while there. He 
continued to feel fatigued and weak at the time he presented to 
a scheduled follow up appointment with his Cardiologist Dr. 
___ (___). He had a TTE in the office that 
showed anteroseptal apical, anterolateral apical and 
inferoapical hypokinesis to akinesis. He was noted to have mild 
symmetrical LVH. EF estimated to be 60%. Upon seeing these 
findings, patient was referred to ___ for further work up and 
possible intervention. He took a full ASA prior to arrival.

In the ED initial vitals were: 97.7 75 148/68 16 99% RA.  

EKG: noted by ED staff to be NSR, rate 71, non-specific IVCD, 
LAD, and LVH.  

Labs/studies notable for: normal coagulation studies, normal 
CBC, normal chemistries except for BUN/Cr 36/2.3, trop-T <0.01, 
CK-MB 3.

Patient was given: lorazepam 0.25 mg IV x1 and briefly started 
on maintenance IVF.

Cardiology was consulted and recommended admission for risk 
stratification.

Vitals on transfer: 97.6 67 132/72 19 97% RA.  

On the floor patient denies any lightheadedness or dizziness. 
When he initially sat up in bed on arrival to the floor, he 
experienced a sharp epigastric pain that had resolved by time of 
interview. He notes that this is like his ""duodenal spasms"" that 
he sometimes gets and is not like the feelings he had when he 
initially presented to ___. Mr. ___ notes that he always 
sleeps on three pillows at night and that this is not a new 
issue for him. He denies PND. He occasionally snores but has 
never had a sleep study. He denies any SOB at rest or with 
exertion. He reports what he describes as occasional PVCs.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, syncope, or presyncope.

On further review of systems, denies any prior history of 
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, 
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies exertional 
buttock or calf pain. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

======================
___ CXR
In comparison with the study of ___, the single lead 
pacer device 
again extends to the right atrium.  Cardiac silhouette is at the 
upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged without appreciable 
vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 

Specifically, no evidence of amiodarone toxicity. 

___ ECHO
The left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There 
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and distal third 
of the ventricle.. The remaining segments contract normally 
(LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of mitral 
regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

 IMPRESSION:Left ventricular cavity dilation with regional 
systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). 
Moderate mitral regurgitation. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricular cavity is now dilated with improved 
function of the mid inferor and inferolateral walls and 
increased severity of mitral regurgitation.

___ BIOPSY AND PATHOLOGY 

Uncomplicated 18-gauge biopsy x 2 of a 4.9 x 2.8 cm left gluteal 
lesion, with
specimen sent to pathology.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS 
Soft tissue, left buttock, biopsy: Carcinoma consistent with 
breast origin, see note. Note: The metastasis is histologically 
similar to this patient's breast primary (___). Additional 
studies will be reported upon in an addendum.

=======================
IMAGING 
=======================

___ BONE SCAN 

The images show focally increased tracer uptake in the distal 
left femur, the
left SI joint, the thoracic spine and left proximal humerus, all 
similar to the
prior study.  The head was not positioned similarly to the prior 
study and
therefore the calvarial lesion cannot be compared. The above 
described findings are consistent with stable metastatic 
disease. The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the 
normal route of tracer excretion. The right hydroureter is less 
apparent than on the prior study.

-----------------

___ CT A/P

LOWER CHEST:
For the findings within the chest, please see the report of the 
CT chest from
the same day ___ dictated separately.
 
ABDOMEN:
HEPATOBILIARY:  There is enlargement of the metastasis within 
segment 4A of
the liver, now measuring 2.9 x 2.5 cm, previously 1.1 cm.  No 
other lesions
evident including at the sites of prior metastases seen within 
segments 3 and
4B of the liver No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary 
dilation.  The
gallbladder is normal in appearance, without stones or 
gallbladder wall
thickening.
PANCREAS: The pancreas is normal in appearance, without focal 
lesion, duct
dilation or evidence of parenchymal disease.
SPLEEN:  The spleen is normal in size and appearance.
ADRENALS:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal in 
appearance.
KIDNEYS:  The right hydronephrosis has slightly worsened and is 
now moderate
-severe in degree.  On the 3 min delayed images there is no 
excretion from the
right kidney into the collecting system indicating complete 
obstruction.  The
right ureter is dilated down to about the crossing of the iliac 
vessels where
there is an enhancing 7 mm abnormality that likely represents a 
metastasis. 
No focal renal lesion of concern on the right with 2 
subcentimeter hypodense
lesions within the right kidney likely representing cysts and 
unchanged. 
subcentimeter left renal lesion is likely a cyst unchanged.  No 
left
hydronephrosis or concerning finding.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Small and large bowel within the abdomen are 
normal.
RETROPERITONEUM AND PERITONEUM: There are multifocal sites of 
stranding with
soft tissue nodularity within the omentum anteriorly, concerning 
for
peritoneal implants of tumor.  There is also all stranding and 
slight
nodularity within the right pericolic gutter along the 
peritoneum, consistent
with tumor deposits.  No ascites.
VASCULAR:  No abdominal aortic aneurysm. Major arteries and 
veins of the
abdomen show no concerning findings.
LYMPH NODES: There are new retroperitoneal lymph nodes just 
inferior to the
renal vein and an anterior periaortic location measuring 9 and 7 
mm in short
axis that are suspicious.
 
PELVIS:

BOWEL: Small and large bowel within the pelvis are normal in 
appearance. The
appendix is normal.
BLADDER: Urinary bladder shows no definite abnormalities.
OTHER:  Small round enhancing 1.3 cm focus between the cervix in 
the right
bladder wall is unchanged over multiple exams.  The uterus and 
bilateral
ovaries show no concerning findings.  Trace free fluid is seen 
within the
pelvis.  No hernia is evident.
LYMPH NODES:  No lymphadenopathy evident.
 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:
Within the left gluteus maximus muscle superiorly and bordering 
on the left
iliac crest there is a 4.1 x 3.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing 
mass consistent
with a metastasis.  This may have extended locally from the 
metastasis within
the left iliac bone that was seen on the prior study, however 
the bony
metastasis appears unchanged in appearance or as the gluteal 
metastasis has
increased in size since ___.  Enhancing lesion 
within the
paraspinal musculature on the left at L4-L5 measures 9 mm and is 
concerning
for a metastasis.  Slightly superior to this at L4 there is a 
smaller
hyperenhancing focus along the posterior aspect of the left 
paraspinal muscle
that is likely a metastasis.  1 cm enhancing lesion along the 
superficial
aspect of the paraspinal muscles on the left at T11 is minimally 
increased in
size.  1 cm enhancing lesion is seen along the anterior aspect 
of the right
iliacus just above the acetabulum, a new focus suspicious for 
metastasis. 
There are a few other scattered nodules within the subcutaneous 
fat that are
new or enlarged compared to the prior studies and could 
represent metastases. 
Heterogeneous predominately sclerotic metastases within the left 
pubic rami
and left iliac bone are unchanged.  No new definite bone 
metastases.
 
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Progression of disease with enlargement segment 4A liver 
metastasis, multiple
new and enlarged muscular metastases, new omental and peritoneal 
disease, and
new retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
 
Moderate-severe right hydronephrosis has progressed and is 
secondary to an
enhancing right ureteral lesion which is concerning for 
metastasis.
 
Stable- appearing left pubic and iliac bone metastases.

-----------------

___ CT CHEST 
 
Supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes are not pathologically 
enlarged. 
Patient has had bilateral mastectomy and breast reconstruction.  
A 15 mm wide
cluster of small nodules has developed in the left breast, 05:42 
warranting
further investigation.  New there are no other findings in the 
imaged chest
wall suspicious for malignancy.  Findings below the diaphragm 
will be reported
separately.
 
Severe shoulder artifact obscures evaluation of the thyroid 
which nevertheless
look substantially more heterogeneous today than previously, an 
indication for
ultrasound evaluation.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification is not apparent in head neck 
vessels or coronary
arteries.  Aorta is normal size.  Pulmonary arteries are 
enlarged, main 39 mm,
6:156, right 27 mm, also unchanged.
 
There is no pericardial or right pleural effusion.  Small 
layering,
nonhemorrhagic, left pleural effusion has increased.
 
Lymph nodes:
 
6 mm prevascular mediastinal node, 6:109, was 3 mm in ___.  
Infiltrative
lymph node enlargement throughout the left hilus, maximum 
diameter 11 mm,
6:145 has increased.
 
Lungs:
 
7 x 13 mm left apical nodule, 6:83, was 5 x 12 mm in ___ x 8 mm right upper lobe nodule, 6:158, was 4 x 5 mm in 
___ x 9 mm perifissural nodule left upper lobe, 6:121, was 5 x 8 
mm, now
contiguous with the progressively thickened fissure and the 
upper pole of the
left hilus, 6:141.
 
For by her 11 mm fissural thickening left major fissure has 
grown.
 
Small irregular nodules and interstitial infiltration, left lung 
radiating
from the lower pole of the left hilus and extending into the 
periphery of
mostly the right lower lobe, with discrete nodular components, 9 
mm, right
lower lobe, 6:240 and 6 x 16 mm, right lower lobe, 6:215 could 
be local
lymphangitic extension of carcinoma.
 
 There are no pathologic or compression fractures or a 
destructive lesions in
the chest cage.  Endplate sclerosis at several levels in the 
thoracic spine is
probably discogenic.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Linear and nodular abnormality radiating from the lower pole of 
the left
hilus, now containing larger infiltrative nodal tissue, into the 
left lower
lobe contributing to small left lower lobe nodules is probably 
local
lymphangitic carcinoma, also explaining new small left pleural 
effusion.
 
Slight interval growth of 3 small lung nodules.
 
New cluster of subcentimeter nodules reconstructed left breast, 
suspicious for
carcinoma.
 
Possible chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 4:44 ___ 

1. There are intracranial brain metastases, largest involving 
left cerebellum measuring 3.2 cm with moderate adjacent edema 
and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle.  There is mild 
linear periventricular FLAIR hyperintensity adjacent to the 
lateral ventricles, which may represent chronic small vessel 
ischemic changes or edema related to very early hydrocephalus, 
although the ventricles are not significantly dilated.  Close 
clinical follow-up recommended. 
2. There is single osseous discrete metastasis.  There is 
diffuse decreased T1 signal involving calvarial marrow, which

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male ___ speaking history of 
severe COPD status post bilateral lung resection as well as AAA 
status post ___ R, on Eliquis, who presents after fall from 
standing with head strike and who became altered in route and 
was diverted from previous destination, ___, to ___ 
___ for further care. 

Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was obtunded, not moving any 
extremities, had bruising over bilateral lower quadrants of the 
abdomen, pupils equal round reactive to light 3-4 mm, and had an 
abrasion over upper lip right-sided

He was intubated for altered mental using Versed for sedation. 
The patient became hypotensive following sedation and so 
Levophed was started after receiving 200 mcg of push dose 
Neo-Synephrine without increase in his blood pressures. He then 
had a NCCTH which showed no evidence of head bleed. He was noted 
to have convulsions/ shaking by nursing and was loaded with 
Keppra. Also, given the patient's altered mental status. 
vasopressor requirement, and recent discharge from ___ for 
aspiration PNA, he was given IV Vanc and Zosyn for broad 
spectrum antibiotic coverage. 

A pan scan was done and showed RLL pneumonia, multiple pulmonary 
nodules, severe emphysema, and infrarenal AAA. The study was, 
however, limited by extravasation of contrast. Given the 
extravasation, plastic surgery was consulted in the ED to 
evaluate and stated that there was no compartment syndrome but 
advised doing dopplers and frequent arm/hand checks overnight.

IMAGING:
___ CTA head: 
Impressions:
1. 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm inferior and medially projecting aneurysm 
originating from the junction of the anterior communicating 
artery and the right anterior cerebral artery with a lobular 
contour and multiple outpouchings, as described.  There is 
subtle hyperdensity layering in the bilateral occipital horns 
compatible with mixed age ventricular hemorrhage, demonstrated 
on outside hospital MRI. 
2. There is very mild subtle extra-axial hyperdensity along the 
right temporal lobe, which likely corresponds to subdural 
hemorrhage seen on prior outside hospital MRI. 
3. Patent neck vasculature without carotid stenosis by NASCET 
criteria. 
4. 3.2 x 3.0 cm lobular cystic lesion with peripheral 
calcification at the 
right axilla with partially visualize severe degenerative 
changes of the 
glenohumeral joint which may represent a cystic mass, cystic 
node, a distended shoulder bursa.  Consider dedicated shoulder 
MRI to further characterize this finding, if shoulder pathology 
is suspected.  Conversely if there is concern for cystic 
necrotic lymph node, mammogram could also be performed. 
5. Mosaic ground-glass opacity within the lung apices which may 
represent air trapping, atelectasis, or, less likely an 
infectious or inflammatory process. 
6. 4 mm ground-glass nodule at the left lung apex.  Per the 
___ guidelines, no followup is necessitated for 
lesion of this size. 
7. 2.8 x 2.2 cm heterogeneous right thyroid lobe nodule.  
Recommend follow-up noncontrast thyroid ultrasound, if not 
previously performed. 
8. Partially visualize mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy 
which may be 
infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic.  Recommend clinical 
correlation and consider completion CT of the chest to further 
characterize this finding. 

___ THYROID US
Dominant mostly cystic spongiform nodule within the right 
thyroid.  Based on size criteria this nodules amenable to 
fine-needle aspiration however given the patient's age and the 
benign features of the nodule, follow-up with ultrasound in ___ 
year is reasonable. 

___ MRI T-SPINE w/wo contrast
1.  Multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes throughout 
the cervical 
spine, more significant at C5/C6 and C6/C7 levels, no focal or 
diffuse lesions are noted throughout the cervical spinal cord, 
there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement in the cervical 
region.  
2.  Multilevel multifactorial degenerative changes are 
visualized throughout 
the thoracic spine, more significant at T9/T10 level, consistent 
with 
spondylosis and disc protrusion, causing mild anterior thecal 
sac deformity and moderate left-sided neural foraminal 
narrowing, the signal intensity throughout the thoracic spinal 
cord is normal with no evidence of focal or diffuse lesions, 
there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. 
3.  Note is made of a partially evaluated, apparently loculated 
cystic 
formation identified in the region of the right scapula towards 
the right 
shoulder, probably consistent with a cystic subscapular bursa, 
correlation 
with dedicated MRI of the shoulder in the scapular region is 
recommended for further characterization. 
4.  Schmorl's node is identified at L1/L2 level in the lumbar 
spine, 
associated with disc protrusion, causing bilateral neural 
foraminal narrowing and moderate spinal canal stenosis. 
5.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis is noted at L5/S1 level, probably 
degenerative in nature.  Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative 
changes throughout the lumbar spine as described above, there is 
no evidence of abnormal enhancement in the lumbar region. 

___  CHEST XRAY
Impression:
Possible 1.5cm lower lobe lung mass, should be evaluated by 
Chest CT. 
Subcentimeter calcified nodules in the right lower lung, 
probably due to 
remote granulomatous infection; no evidence of active infection. 


___ CT head wo contrast (for new anisocoria)
1. No acute intracranial abnormality on noncontrast head CT.  
Specifically no intracranial hemorrhage.

seizure-like activity. Patent reported that he started shaking 
in his chair. Per patient's husband, patient woke up in the 
morning and took his morning medications. As he was sitting in 
the chair, he developed shaking in all extremities and decreased 
responsiveness of unknown duration but remained in chair and 
tried to drink water during the episode; reportedly patient also 
tried to speak and said ""I can't handle this anymore"". He would 
open and close eyes spontaneously and did not have any gaze 
deviation. The whole episode lasted ___ min, stopped for a few 
minutes, then started again. However, when the EMS arrived, they 
noted he was only responsive to pain, which improved as he was 
being transferred to the ED. On arrival to the ED, he triggered 
for tachycardia and had 1 seizure in the ED, lasting 2 minutes. 
He initially started shaking but would flinch to confrontation 
bilaterally. He then developed eye deviation, stiffened and 
progressed to develop tonic-clonic shaking. He also desatted to 
the ___ during this episode. He received 2 mg Ativan iv which 
stopped the shaking. He still had some roving eyes after the 
episode, as well as confusion and some right arm shaking. He was 
loaded with phenobarbital for alcohol withdrawal and keppra for 
the seizure.

Of note, reportedly patient also had a fall with head strike but 
no LOC 4 days prior for which he did not present to the ICU. 

In the ED, initial VS were notable for;
Temp 98.3  HR 136  BP 142/80  RR 24  SaO2 96% RA. 
Patient triggered for tachycardia and had a seizure in the ED, 
as described above.

Examination notable for: Chronically ill appearing male with no

normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF = 70%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

he was walking to the store when he started having chest pain,
___ all across his chest and radiating down both shoulders and
arms. He also had diaphoresis, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. He
was unable to climb up the stairs at home which was unusual for
him. He was given ASA, nitro, and Zofran by EMS which he states
did not alleviate the pain. EKG done by EMS was normal. No
vomiting or abdominal pain. He states that about once a month he
has some chest pain for a few minutes, but never this intense or
for this long. 

In the ED, initial VS were 97.0 88 104/60 20 94% Nasal Cannula.
He was reportedly hypoxia to the ___ on RA.
Labs notable for a CBC with a WBC of 7.0, H/H of 11.8/38.4, Plt
158. BMP notable for BUN/Cr of ___. Tropononin of 0.06 which
increased to 0.18. proBNP 189. 
CTA notable for extensive filling defects of the bilateral
pulmonary arteries extending into subsegmental branches 
involving
all lobes. There was a mild interval increase in the size of the
right ventricle, suggestive of mild right heart strain. 
MASCOT was consulted and given that he was hemodynamically
stable, they recommended TTE in the morning and continuation of
IV heparin.
He received IV morphine sulfate 4 mg x 1 and was initiated on IV
heparin.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient tells the story as above.
He reports onset of lightheadedness, chest pressure, shortness 
of
breath, nausea, which required him to rest multiple times. He
reports he felt presyncopal after climbing one flight of stairs
and sat down and called his wife from his landing. He otherwise
denies fevers, chills, recent illnesses, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria, headache. He denies recent travel. He denies
changes in mobility, although his wife reports that he is fairly
immobile throughout the day.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old with no significant PMH presenting as transfer from 
___ for evaluation of chest pain.  Per report, pt was 
sitting at his computer reading the morning of ___ when he 
developed a sudden onset choking sensation in his throat with 
associated anterior chest tightness and discomfort. He reports 
some diaphoresis and noted that the anterior chest discomfort 
was worse with deep inspiration. EMS was called and pt was given 
aspirin and two SL nitro tablets, which did not improve his 
chest discomfort. He was subsequently taken to ___ where 
EKG did not demonstrate evidence of ischemia. CXR and neck X-ray 
were unremarkable. Pt was given a GI cocktail with no immediate 
improvement in symptoms, however his choking sensation improved 
while in the ED. Initial troponin I was 0.01 and second troponin 
I at 3 hrs was 0.05. EKG was repeated, and again did not 
demonstrate ischemic changes. However, pt was noted to have 
developed a left arm aching. SL nitro was administered and the 
pt's pain resolved. Pt was seen by ___ of interventional 
cardiology at ___ and did not believe pt needed urgent 
cardiac cath, but recommended transfer to ___. In addition, he 
was started on a heparin gtt and nitroglycerin gtt prior to 
transfer.  
 In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8 90 123/67 18 94% RA  
 - Exam was normal  
 - Labs were notable for: WBC 17.1, H/H 13.2/39.7, plts 255, Na

History of Present Illness:
___ female with history of CHF, pulmonary hypertension 
+/- COPD on 4L nasal cannula O2 at home, presenting for 
shortness of breath and fatigue. 

Per the patient and her daughter, patient has been feeling more 
short of breath and tired over past week since  getting a ""cold"" 
last week. States that last week she developed nasal congestion 
and a cough productive of scant greenish sputum. During this 
time she also noticed weight gain (236 lbs on ___ compared to 
about ~216 pounds at recent baseline) and increased swelling of 
her lower extremities. Complained of fatigue which because much 
worse over the weekend prior to presentation. She denied any 
fevers, chills, chest pain or pressure, abdominal pain/cramping 
or any other concerning symptoms during this time. No recent 
medication changes. She has continued to adhere to her low 
sodium diet.

Patient's health has been poor since a hospitalization last 
___ at ___. During this admission she was 
diagnosed with and treated for CHF. In addition, several 
pulmonary problems were identified at this admission. She has 
been told that she has COPD and also that she likely has 
pulmonary hypertension. She has been trying to get to ___ to 
see Dr. ___ for assessment of her pulmonary 
hypertension and possible treatment.

After that admission, she was discharged home on supplemental 
O2:4L O2 via nasal cannula at rest and increases to 5L nasal 
cannula O2 with exertion. She closely monitors her O2 
saturations at home and is usually 87-90% at rest and routinely 
drops sats to the mid-70s% with exertion. She denies any 
symptoms associated with these desat events.

In the ED initial vitals were:  T 97.2, HR 87, BP 149/70, RR 25, 
O2 96% on NRB after presenting with O2 88% on 5L NC. Placed on 
BiPAP, but did not tolerate it and then back to 6L NC. Triggered 
initially for VS criteria, stabilized with supplemental O2.

EKG: Rate ___, sinus, Rightward axis, LBBB. 
  
Labs/studies notable for: VBG 7.46/33/___; Na=127; WBC=13.6; 
Tpn-T<0.01; proBNP=7993.

Patient was given:  Furosemide 40mg IV x 2 (at 14:28 and then 
22:36), Foley was placed.

Reported output from time in ED to floor arrival is 
approximately 4650 cc (2800 cc, then 1850 cc).

On the floor, patient still feels short of breath and tired but 
improved compared to prior.

Soon after arrival to the floor, patient desatted to mid-70s% 
with moving in bed and was triggered for hypoxia. She was placed 
on non-rebreather but did not tolerate it and had increased 
coughing. Nasal cannula restarted at 6 LPM and O2 sats improved 
to 88-90% with rest.

IMAGING:
==================
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Hyperdensity overlying the vertebrae of the lower thoracic spine 
may represent
osseous metastatic disease.  Superimposed pulmonary abnormality 
such as
pneumonia or nodule cannot be excluded.

MRI Spine ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive osseous metastatic disease.  No associated 
pathologic compression
fracture
2. There is an area of T2 area of signal abnormality in the 
dorsal spinal
canal at the C5 level, without convincing enhancement.  It is of 
uncertain
etiology and small metastatic focus is not excluded in the 
context of the
fairly extensive metastases although it does not clearly 
enhance.  Further
assessment from high-resolution targeted imaging of the cervical 
spine may be useful.  It does not cause definite compression of 
the spinal cord, although of note, there is spinal cord edema at 
C3 through C5 without enhancement, near the indeterminate focus 
of signal abnormality.
3. Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy likely reflecting metastatic 
disease.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the spine most 
pronounced in the
lower lumbar spine with severe neural foraminal narrowing at the 
L4-L5 and
L5-S1 levels as well as severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4 
and L4-L5.
PREVALENCE:  Prevalence of lumbar degenerative disk disease in 
subjects
without low back pain:
Overall evidence of disk degeneration 91% (decreased T2 signal, 
height loss,
bulge)
T2 signal loss 83%
Disk height loss 58%
Disk protrusion 32%
Annular fissure 38%

Lumbar spinal stenosis prevalence- present in approximately 20% 
of
asymptomatic adults over ___ years old
___, et al, Spine Journal ___ 9 (7):___
 
These findings are so common in asymptomatic persons that they 
must be
interpreted with caution and in context of the clinical 
situation.

L SPINE FLEX and EXT: ___
IMPRESSION: 
Anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 without change in alignment between 
flexion and
extension. Degenerative changes.  Multifocal sclerotic lesions 
concerning for metastatic disease.

HIP X-RAY ___:
IMPRESSION: 
No previous images.  There are multiple areas of sclerosis 
involving the
visualized lumbar vertebral bodies as well as several bones of 
the pelvis,
consistent with the clinical diagnosis of metastatic prostate 
cancer. 
Substantial hypertrophic spurring and intervertebral disc space 
narrowing is
consistent with degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.
Relatively mild degenerative changes in the left hip joint, 
symmetric with the
appearance on the right.  No evidence of fracture.  However, if 
an occult
fracture is a serious clinical concern, MRI could be obtained.

CT CHEST ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute pulmonary parenchymal findings.
2.  Moderate emphysema.  7 mm nodule versus component of 
subpleural scarring
in the right apex, and a additional bilateral pulmonary nodules. 
 In this
patient with underlying emphysema, ___ noncontrast CT of 
the chest in
___ months is recommended.
3.  Ill-defined lesion measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.4 x 2.4 
cm in the
hepatic dome, which should be further characterized with 
multiphasic CT or MRI
of the liver.
4.  Diffuse sclerosis of the T9 and T10 vertebral bodies, also 
partially
involving the posterior elements.  Additional sclerotic lesions 
in other
thoracic vertebral bodies, as well as partially imaged in the L1 
vertebral
body.  Findings are concerning for blastic metastases.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  1.  Noncontrast CT of the chest in ___ 
months.
2.  Multiphasic CT or MRI of the liver.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with T2DM (poorly 
controlled with medications), trigeminal neuralgia, and tobacco 
use disorder who presented to ___ with chest pain and was 
transferred here with concern for NSTEMI.

On ___ night at 6PM she developed an acute ""ache"" in the 
___ her chest that radiated to her L arm. She tried to 
sleep it off, but the pain continued throughout ___. It was 
associated with mild shortness of breath, but no nausea, 
diaphoresis, other symptoms. She has never had pain like this 
before. She reports that over the last ___ years, she has been 
more ""tired"" and has had decreased exercise tolerance, which she 
attributes primarily to ""weakness in her legs"". She denies any 
dyspnea with exertion or upon lying flat and denies any chest 
pain with exertion. She also states she has lost about 25 pounds
unintentionally in the past 6 months. Her family corroborates 
that prior to the past several years she was quite active.

Due to persistent pain, she presented to ___. There, she was 
found to have an elevated troponin, Q waves in the inferior 
leads, and SoB with nausea. She was given ASA, Pepcid and Zofran 
and subsequently was pain free. She was started on a heparin 
drip and sent here.

From the emergency department here, she went directly to the 
cath lab, where she was found to have total occlusion of the RCA 
and significant proximal LAD disease. Because of her smoking and 
DM history, she was not intervened upon so that cardiac surgery 
could be consulted. She received 2000U heparin in the cath lab.

denies any chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, or symptoms of any 
kind. She is quite anxious about taking her Carbamazapine for 
trigeminal neuralgia as she normally takes it at 0330 and 1530 
and it was 4PM when I was speaking with her.

She seems to be relatively opposed to surgery, primarily because 
she says ""I don't want a big scar on my chest"". Her family seems 
to be in favor of surgery and she is willing to meet with the 
surgery team to discuss options.

Of note, she has infrequent contact with physicians. She has a 
primary care physician who she sees ""from time to time""; says it 
has probably been more than a year since she last saw him. She 
was on metformin for her diabetes but could not tolerate it due 
to GI distress and stopped it. She has not taken any other
medicine for DM recently.
 
ROS with positives as per HPI; otherwise negative.

IMAGING
=======
Intraop (TEE) Echocardiogram, ___
Conclusions   
 No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left 
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the 
left atrial appendage. A small patent foramen ovale is present. 
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at 
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
basal inferior and mid inferoseptal, and inferior RWMA. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There 
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. A mildly eccentric, posteriorly 
directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. 

POST-BYPASS:
 Rhythm: A paced
 Infusions: Epinephrine, and Phenylephrine

 1. Biventricular function remains unchanged. Inferior and 
inferoseptal hypokinesis remains unchanged.
 2. Valvular structure and function remains unchanged. Moderate 
MR and Moderate TR unchanged in severity
 3. Visualized portion of the Aorta remains unchanged.

Cardiac Cath ___:

tightness and pressure with no radiations. Patient states that 
this is improved however is constant and has been for the last 
couple hours. Patient denies any fevers chills or infectious 
signs or symptoms. Patient denies any drug use or known cardiac 
history.

FINDINGS:  
  
1.  Ultrasound revealed the liver is on the left side of the 
body which is 
consistent with the MRI and the history of situs inversus. 
2.  Percutaneous transhepatic needle cholangiogram demonstrating 
nondilated bile ducts with limited flow of contrast through the 
anastomosis of the biliary tree with the bowel. 
3.  Pull-back sheath cholangiogram demonstrating high-grade 
narrowing at the anastomosis of the biliary tree with the bowel 
with passage of some of the contrast through the narrowing. 
4.  Post cholangio plasty cholangiogram demonstrating improved 
flow through the area of narrowing. 
5.  10 ___ internal external biliary drain in appropriate 
position with 
sideholes above and below the area of narrowing. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Fluoroscopically minimally dilated-nondilated bile ducts with a 
stenosis at the region of the biliary-enteric anastomosis with 
sluggish drainage that was treated with cholangioplasty and 
internal-external biliary drain placement. 

 LIVER ULTRASOUND ___
A PTBD is visualized in situ within the left upper quadrant 
hepatic parenchyma due to situs inversus.  The exam is 
technically limited due to overlying bandages and patient 
discomfort, however no definite collection is identified in the 
left upper quadrant. 
Please note ultrasound is not the preferred modality to exclude 
a bile leak. 

CTAP W & WO CONTRAST ___
1. Status post PTBD placement without evidence of biliary 
dilation. 
2. 3 cm subcapsular hepatic fluid collection at the site of 
hepatic access 
which likely represents a resolving hematoma, however abscess 
cannot be 
excluded. 

BILIARY CATHCHECK ___
1.  Cholangiogram through the existing tube demonstrates the 
tube is in good position and is patent.  Contrast is seen 
filling intrahepatic biliary ducts, and contrast passes through 
the anastomosis is also noted.  No biliary leak, contrast 
extension along the tube tract and/or into any pericapsular 
collection is identified. 
2.  Limited abdominal ultrasound demonstrates a small lenticular 
capsular 
focus of fluid, which is similar in size if not smaller compared 
to the CT 
scan.  This was not felt to be amenable to aspiration.  No new 
or enlarging collection was identified. 

BILIARY CATHREPLACE ___
1. Left percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheters.
2. Cholangiogram showing antegrade flow of contrast across the 
biliary anastomosis.
3. Successful exchange of left percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage catheters with new 10 ___ anchor catheters.

- Patient was given:   albuterol, ipratropium nebs 
methylprednisolone 125 mg IV  amiodarone 150 mg then gtt NS 250 
mL

On arrival to the CCU, patient was continued on BiPaP and 
nebulizers (switched to levoalbuterol), and was started on 
azithromycin, prednisone, IV Lasix 40mg, and a nicotine patch. 
His BPs improved to 100s/80s (MAPs ___ with O2 sats in the 96% 
with BiPaP. He was given metoprolol 6.25mg q6 PO for his 
multifocal atrial tachycardia. 

Please see original admission note for full HPI, past medical, 
surgical, home medications, allergies, family and social history 
of which I agree with and have confirmed with patient.

In brief, Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy (EF 30%) thought to be attributed to prior 
cocaine use, pulmonary hypertension, COPD not on home O2 who 
initially presented to ___ with acute on subacute worsening 
shortness of breath.

Patient states over the last 2 weeks he has noticed worsening 
shortness of breath that was initially intermittent however 
since became constant with acute worsening on day prior to 
presentation with SOB at rest. Has also been describing 
persistent chest pressure in his throat. Endorsing orthopnea, no 
worsening lower extremity edema, has been adherent to his home 
Lasix. 

On arrival to ___, initial VS T 98.4 P ___ 108/78, RR 21, O2 
100%RA. Per report, he had frequent runs of VT lasting about 5 
seconds. Patient was ASA loaded, started on heparin drip, and 
amiodarone loaded and started on amiodarone drip with resolution 
of ventricular ectopy. Was noted on EKG to have deep Q waves and 
STE across precordium unchanged from prior EKGs. Troponins were 
negative and given  Was also hypoxemic requiring BiPAP there on 
transfer to ___.

Here in the ED he was continued on amiodarone. Given concern for 
possible COPD exacerbation was given IV methylpred, started on 
azithromycin.

In the CCU, on review of prior EKGs and telemetry strips from 
CHA, was determined to previously have multifocal atrial 
tachycardia and not VT, also with no evidence of VT here during 
CCU stay. Rates improved after starting Metoprolol 6.25mg PO 
Q6H. Was continued on azithromycin, started on prednisone burst 
40mg daily, and diuresed with Lasix 40 IV and 20 IV for mild 
interstitial pulmonary congestion. Was quickly weaned from BiPAP 
to room air and transferred to the floor.

History of Present Illness:
___ PMH HTN, CAD, p/w dyspnea, productive cough and
fatigue/dizziness for ___ days. He complains of a chronic cough
for the past 2 months, which acutely worsened over the past
several days. The patient stated that for ___ days he has had
dyspnea at rest that is associated with productive cough. He
describes the quality as greenish in nature. In addition, the
patient is complaining of worsening BLLE swelling (R>L) for the
past several years. He denied fevers/chills, chest pain,
orthopnea, PND and palpitations. He denies sick contacts and
recent travel. Per family at bedside, the patient refuses to go
outside during the winter for fear of falling. They were
attempting to convince him to visit his PCP for the worsening
BLLE, however, he believed that due to his insurance, he was
unable to see his PCP. The patient was transported via EMS to 
the
ED.   

In the emergency department, he was found to be hypotensive and
tachycardic, but was saturating at 100%. His exam was notable 
for
bilateral lower extremity edema and bibasilar crackles. A proBNP
was significantly elevated to 6766 and was diuresed with IV
Lasix. A chest xray was also concerning for a lobar pneumonia 
and
the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Shortly
after receiving IV Lasix, the patient developed hypotension, was
given a bolus of fluid and started on levophed. Subsequently, 
the
patient developed afib with RVR. Levophed was held, but the
patient had persistent hypotension and tachycardia to 150-170's.
Cardiology was consulted, the ED and Cards decided to add 
esmolol
for rate control and continue levophed for pressure management. 
A
CT was also performed with concern for PE. It revealed a PNA, 
but
no evidence of PE. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: Temp 98.3, HR 112, BP 105/70, RR
18 100% RA 

- Exam notable for: bilateral crackles, BLLE swelling R>L,
systolic murmur. 
- Labs notable for: BUN/Creat 36/1.5, H/H 10.9/33.7, proBNP 
6766,
trop plateau at 0.03. 
- Imaging was notable for: CT:
-- Right lower lobe bronchus is focally narrowed secondary to
diffuse
   bronchial wall thickening. Bibasilar right greater than left
atelectasis with a right lower lobe bronchopneumonia. No 
evidence
of PE.
- Patient was given: 
  -ASA 81mg
  -Losartan Potassium 50mg
  -Omeprazole 20mg
  -Prazosin 2mg
  -Furosemide 40mg
  -Ceftriaxone 1gm IV
  -Azithromycin 500mg IV
  -Norepinephrine 0.03-0.25mcg
  -Esmolol 50-150mcg/kg/min

Upon arrival to the ICU, patient reports significant symptomatic
improvement. He denies dyspnea, DOE, chest pain, orthopnea, PND,
abdominal pain, and n/v/d/c.  

Review of systems was negative except as detailed above.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yoM with a history of ETOH abuse/withdrawal 
seizures, depression/anxiety, HTN, distant hernia repair, 
?stented CAD, who presents with recurrent, seizures.  

 The patient was found at the bottom of a flight of stairs 
yesterday by his mother (12 stairs, unclear how many he fell 
down, no thud heard). EMS found him to be having ___ 
seizures, lasted about 18 minutes requiring 10 mg of IV diazepam 
before breaking. He was brought to ___ where he had 
another ___ min seizure and was loaded with a gram of Keppra and 
more diazepam. At that time the patient was complaining of 
shortness of breath, hypoxic to the high ___ on a NRB. He was 
intubated and started on propofol. He had 2 episodes of 
breakthrough seizures while at ___ and en route and required 
10 mg of diazepam each (succ/etom/morphine, 8 ET).  

 The patient's parents have been staying with him recently, has 
been complaining of neck and R shoulder/back pain after a ski 
accident 2 weeks ago. Prior to the event was last seen 90 min 
prior, was reportedly lucid. 4 days ago he complained of chest 
pressure that has since resolved. Had a HA 4 days ago as well, 
not complaining of any since, no blurry vision.  

 Recent history notable for 2 admissions for seizures in the 
last week, 1 to ___ and one to ___. On ___ the pt 
presented to ___ after being found be EMS to be dyspneic and 
intoxicated in his bathtub. Had been sober for several months 
but over the last month has been drinking 1L vodka daily, 
unclear if he has made any attempts to cut down. Found to be 
hypoxic to the ___, apneic in the ED, and intubated. ETOH level 
was 378. ___ reportedly negative. Clinically they did not 
suspect seizure but was given CIWA/benzo taper. Extubated 
quickly to RA and was unable to be convinced to stay and go to 
detox, discharged with diazepam prn. Then had ___ 
activity 2 days PTA and was sent to ___ ED, reportedly fell 
down ___ stairs after drinking a pint of vodka (unclear if 
seizure activity before or after) but EMS saw tonic/clonic 
activity, broke with 5 IV valium, discharged after trauma 
imaging was negative.  

 The patient was apparently admitted to a ___ facility ___ 
after a withdrawal seizure and had been sober until 1 month ago. 
 
 In the ED, pt was hemodynamically stable, hypertensive to the 
170s. Labs with lactate 2.3, tox with pos benzos, opiates, ETOH 
91. Imaging with neg head CT, CT Cspine with likely DJD C4 
retrolisthesis. CT torso with basilar infiltrates c/w 
aspiration, steatotic liver. Oxygenating well on AC vent 
settings. He received 1L IVF, propofol gtt. Neurology 
recommended MICU admission for likely ETOH withdrawal seizure.  

 On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated/sedated, off 
propofol able to follow basic commands.

PERTINENT IMAGING/STUDIES: 
==========================
___ CXR (Portable): 
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the 
monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  The a OG tube 
extends to the upper stomach, though the side port appears to be 
at the level of the esophagogastric junction.  The tube should 
be pushed forward several cm for optimal positioning. The 
patient has taken a better inspiration.  Opacification at the 
left base most likely represents atelectasis.  Opacification at 
the right base medially could also represent atelectatic 
changes.  However, either or both of these could represent 
developing aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical 
setting. 
 
___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 

___ CT SPINE W/O CONTRAST: 
1. No evidence for a fracture. 
2. Minimal retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 is most likely 
degenerative, though 
there are no comparison exams to confirm chronicity. 
3. Mild multilevel degenerative disease. 

___ CT CHEST ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No fracture or acute traumatic injury. 
2.  Bilateral aspiration in lower lobes of lungs. 
3.  Hepatic lesions enhancing similar to portal vein could be 
large 
hemangiomas.  Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound. 
4.  Hepatosteatosis. 

___ Shoulder and knee xrays - no fracture

Abdominal ultrasound ___:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
2. A 2.2 cm hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe liver dome 
likely corresponds to one of the hyperenhancing lesions seen on 
prior CT.  Appearance is not the typical echogenic appearance of 
hemangioma.  Differential includes atypical appearance of 
hemangioma, hematoma, or other primary liver lesions.  
___ MRI is recommended for further characterization. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ MRI is recommended for further 
characterization. 

___ Lumbar MRI:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Mild degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine with no 
significant 
spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. 
2. Disc bulge at ___ abuts but does not displace the 
transiting right S1 
nerve root.  Recommend correlation with right S1 radiculopathy. 
3. ___ and incompletely imaged/characterized oblong, 
oval signal 
abnormality in the left psoas muscle, with no enhancement seen 
on the recently performed CT, potentially representing a small 
intramuscular hematoma in the setting of trauma, however there 
is no significant surrounding edema pattern and the lesion does 
appear fairly ___.  Recommend a ___ 
___ with ___ lumbar spine MRI 2 document the 
absence of an underlying mass lesion.

___ CXR:
Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
Previous consolidation in the right lower lobe has improved 
substantially,
more characteristic of asymmetric edema or severe aspiration,

No pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.

___ TTE:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately enlarged. The estimated
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
inferior walls (see schematic) and preserved/normal 
contractility of the remaining segments. The visually
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40-45%. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is low normal
(2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater than 
18 mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity size
with normal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus
diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is
normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. There is no 
evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally
normal. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional systolic dysfunction
most consistent with single vessel coronary artery disease (PDA 
distribution). Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.

___ pMIBI:
IMPRESSION: Poor exercise tolerance limited by exertional 
dyspnea. No 
anginal symptoms or objective ECG evidence of myocardial 
ischemia. 
Resting systolic hypertension with an appropriate blood pressure 

response to exercise; exaggerated systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure 
response noted post-exercise. Appropriate heart rate response to 

exercise.

prior episodes of pancreatitis, presenting with chief complaint
of syncopal episode. Of note, the patient had a recent episode 
in
late ___ ___ of pancreatitis for which she had been
hospitalized at ___. She was being managed for persistence of
pancreatitis in the outpatient setting. On the day of admission,
she was travelling to her MRCP with husband when she had brief
syncopal/vasovagal event. Husband called ambulance and was taken
to ___. 

Review of her recent outpatient records suggest as follows. She
was hospitalized at the end ___ through beginning of ___ at
___ for pancreatitis. Following discharge, she continued to
have pain. She underwent repeat CT scan at ___ which showed 
acute
pancreaetitis and two hypoenhancing lesions in the head of the
pancreas and the tail of the pancreas, which could represent
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas, for
which MRCP was recommended.

Review of her first episode of pancreatitis is available through
CHA records. It occurred in ___. Per the discharge summary, she
had an unremarkable workup with normal triglycerides, no history
of heavy alcohol use, and an MRI without pancreatitic mass at
that time. 

In the ED, initial VS were 97.8 72 ___ 96% RA.
Labs notable for normal BMP, CBC WNL, lipase of 335. Phos
elevated at 4.9. 
CT A/P showed findings compatible with acute interstitial
pancreatitis without radiopaque gallstones or biliary dilation
without peripancreatic fluid collection and trace left pleural
effusion.
RUQ ultrasound showed echogenic liver consistent with steatosis.
The patient is well appearing, however, given her vasovagal
event, she was admitted to obtain MRCP and for treatment of
presyncope.
She received IV morphine and IV Zofran.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient tells the story as
follows. She reports that she was hospitalized at ___
for acute pancreatitis at the end ___ through the beginning
of ___. She reported persistent pain during that
hospitalization, however, she wanted to try to manage her pain

significantly escalated. She has been following a clear liquid
diet and has had a very decreased appetite. She reported off and
on fevers which she last measured at 100.1 on ___. She
reports that she was due to have an outpatient MRCP today at the
___. Prior to leaving for the ___, she was in such
a significant amount of pain, she considered presenting to the
emergency room instead. She was a passenger in the car with her
husband when she reports she passed out. She has little memory 
of
the event, but denies seizure like movements or loss of bowel or
bladder function. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath

Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis with pneumonia 
not excluded in the clinical setting 

___ TTE 
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. An eccentric, 
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its 
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). 
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 The apex and free walls of the left ventricle are heavilyy 
trabeculated raising the possibility of noncompaction 
cardiomyopathy.

IMAGING:
=======
OSH NCHCT: my read: 3mm IPH posterior R parietal lobe. 2-3mm IPH
central pons. Multiple chronic BG lacunes, more numerous on the
left than on the right. Extensive periventricular microvascular
ischemic changes. Severe atrophy of cerebellar vermis. 

CT head without contrast: 
THe hyperdense foci in the gray-white matter junction and the
right parietal occipital lobe is again visualized (2; 15),
similar to prior and better visualized on prior CT. No acute
intracranial process such as large vascular territory infarction
or evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Dense bilateral
calcifications are noted in the V4 segments of the vertebral 
arteries in the cavernous portions of bilateral internal carotid
arteries. 
  
CTA head and neck: 
There is an aneurysm in the right cavernous portion of the
internal carotid artery measuring up to 1.1 cm in diameter (3;
233). There is a saccular right carotid terminus aneurysm
measuring 0.4 cm (603; 33). 
  
There is a saccular left supraclinoid aneurysm with calcified
walls measuring of to 0.6 cm in diameter (603; 34). 
  
There is extensive atherosclerotic disease with luminal
irregularity throughout the vasculature especially in bilateral
internal carotid arteries with moderate stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery and mild stenosis of the left internal
carotidd artery (601; 42, 48). 
  
Atherosclerotic calcifications and plaques are also noted in
bilateral vertebral arteries with approximately 50% stenosis of
the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery (3; 213). 
  
Recommendation: 
1.6 cm hypodense right thyroid lobe nodule, can be further
evaluated with an nonurgent outpatient thyroid ultrasound. 

MRI: 

 
  
1. Punctate focus of increased signal is seen within the left 
anterior pons  (4;14) on the diffusion weighted images, with no 
definite correlate on the ADC  map on a background of chronic 
microangiopathy seen on the FLAIR images is  likely artifactual 
in etiology, and less likely a punctate focus of subacute  
infarct.  If there is further clinical concern - close interval 
follow up  would be recommended. 
2. Evidence of small cavernomas versus micro hemorrhages 
involving right 
parietal lobe and pons. 
3. Numerous additional scattered old micro hemorrhages in a 
pattern compatible  with amyloid angiopathy or old hypertensive 
micro bleeds.  Scattered cavernomas is an additional 
consideration and can be seen in the setting of  familial 
cavernous malformation syndrome. 
4. Extensive subcortical and deep white matter T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensities are nonspecific but compatible with chronic 
small vessel disease.",10,"Nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, unspecified",MED

2. Incidental mild dilatation of the ascending aorta to 4.2 cm. 
3. Incidentals include a chronic T7 compression fracture, a T12 
vertebral body hemangioma, diverticulosis, and hepatic 
steatosis.

___ MRI head
Large extremely vascular circumscribed extra-axial mass with 
broad attachment to the dura along the left parietal convexity 
with intra tumoral hemorrhage as described above without 
definite evidence of calvarial or parenchymal invasion. The 
imaging features favor hemangiopericytoma, less likely atypical 
meningioma.

vertebral body hemangioma, diverticulosis, and hepatic 
steatosis. 

___ CTA Brain
1. Left parietal extra-axial mass, better evaluated on MR from 
the day prior. No tumoral involvement of the dural venous 
sinuses. 
2. A filling defect in the left sigmoid sinus has a 
corresponding hypodense filling defect on noncontrast CT head 
from the day prior, suggestive of an arachnoid granulation 
rather than acute thrombus. The more distal left sigmoid sinus 
and internal jugular vein are not well opacified. A given 
unchanged appearance of the dural venous sinuses compared to MR 
in CT from the day prior as well as suggested arachnoid 
granulation on prior CT, this is felt of represent asymmetric 
opacification related to timing of the contrast bolus rather 
than interim thrombus formation.

Pertinent Results:
___ MRI Brain with and without contrast
1. A 2.4 cm left temporal lobe heterogeneously enhancing mass 
with surrounding white matter edema pattern resulting in 
effacement of the adjacent sulci and left temporal horn.  There 
is also a left frontal calvarial enhancing 1.9 cm lesion.  The 
findings are concerning for metastatic disease. 
2. Additional extra-axial lesion abutting the posteromedial left 
temporal lobe demonstrates T2 and gradient echo hypointensity.  
This could represent an additional metastatic lesion given above 
findings, potentially demonstrating micro hemorrhages, however 
the imaging appearance is most suggestive of meningioma. 
3. Additional findings as described above. 

___ CT Chest
Spiculated pulmonary mass in the lateral aspect of the right 
upper is 
concerning for a primary bronchus carcinoma. 2 indeterminate 
pulmonary 
nodules in the right upper lobe (may represent metastatic 
nodules in the same lobe). 
Mildly enlarged right hilar and right lower paratracheal lymph 
nodes are 
concerning for lymph node metastatic disease. 
Suspected left adrenal and cerebral and calvarium metastatic 
disease.  
Bubbly part solid pulmonary nodule in the superior segment of 
the right lower lobe is concerning for a primary lesion in the 
adenocarcinoma spectrum of bronchus carcinomas. 
Pulmonary embolus in the descending pulmonary artery on the 
right. 

___ CT Abdomen/Pelvis
1. Large heterogeneously enhancing mass within the left adrenal 
gland is 
consistent with metastatic disease. 
2. Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes. 
3. No other sites of metastatic disease in the abdomen or 
pelvis.

History of Present Illness:
___ man with history of HLD, no other significant 
medical
history, presenting with chest pain at rest.

The pain began this morning around 6:15 AM, substernal, bandlike
chest pain radiating across the entirety of his chest, with some
numbness and tingling in both of his hands at the time. He and
his wife are both MDs, and his wife became concerned and told 
him
to come to the hospital. He was sitting and eating at the time.
He has never had pain like this before. He did not have any
associated palpitations, dyspnea, or light-headedness, and there
is no positional or pleuritic component to the pain. He did have
a recent 2 day history of watery diarrhea, not black or bloody,
without any significant abdominal pain, however this was 
improved
by ___ evening. He was able to walk up and down stairs with
this chest pain without worsening.

days
ago. No leg swelling, or history of PE/DVT in the past. At
___, he was able to walk around without any pain.

He is not very active at baseline, but does say that he tried 
the
7-minute work-out for ~2 weeks over the past 6 months without 
any
exertional chest pain.

He presented to ___ where he had a workup including
troponin was 0.3, d-dimer negative. Given heparin, morphine,
aspirin, and sent here for further evaluation. At some point
while at ___, his chest pain resolved, and has not
recurred.

In the ED initial vitals were: 96.8 HR88 BP136/88 RR18 98% RA.   

EKG demonstrated mild ST depressions in V2. Labs/studies notable
for: TropT 0.49-->0.45-->0,44. The Patient was given: IV 
Heparin,
Metoprolol Tartrate 6.25 mg, Nitroglycerin SL .3 mg x2, ___
( 1000 mL). A CXR was performed without signs of pulmonary edema
or consolidation.  
 
Vitals on transfer: 
HR 83  BP144/83 RR20 98% RA temp 98.6 

On the floor, he reports no current symptoms. He says that the
chest pain he got while in the ED (for which he was given SLN)
was more like his chronic indigestion, not similar to the chest
pain which brought him in.

lasted ~3 hours. She eventually took ASAx4 with some 
improvement, but then chest pain recurred when she lay down. 
There was no orthopnea. She presented to ___, with no 
EKG changes reportedly seen, troponin-I slightly elevated (0.07, 
although unclear if this is above her baseline). She received 
nitroglycerin, heparin, clopidogrel 75 mg, and more aspirin. She 
was then transferred to ___ for further evaluation. She 
reports the chest pain resolved completely with nitroglycerin, 
but she developed a headache.

Patient additionally reports intermittent hot flashes over the 
past ___ years, with one episode of what feels like a hot flash 
occurring just after the chest pain started, with associated 
nausea and vomiting (which generally occurs with her hot 
flashes). She is having her first period in 5 months. She 
reports the cough over the past 6 weeks has been occasionally 
violent, though she was not having an episode when the chest 
pain started. She thinks she has had some subjective fevers. She 
reports on episode of diarrhea 2 days ago lasting all day. She 
endorses some calf pain on exertion, L>R, since ___ which 
started in the context of a recent fall. She reports no dyspnea, 
pounding headache, syncope or presyncope. 

In the ED initial vitals were T 96.8 HR 89 BP 165/86 RR 18 SaO2 
98% on RA. EKG showed NSR, no ischemic changes and some LVH. CXR 
showed worsened pulmonary edema and cardiac enlargement. Labs

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year-old woman with a history of 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation on apixiban 
and metoprolol and recent MCA infarct, who presents with 
palpitations.

The patient describes having intermittent palpitations for the 
past 2 weeks. However, while at rest the night before admission, 
she started to experience severe palpitations where she felt her 
heart was going to beat out of her chest. These symptoms were 
associated with chest pressure and dyspnea. The symptoms went 
away after about 30 minutes. However, on the morning of 
admission, her symptoms once again returned and have been 
constant. Her palpitations are associated with mild dyspnea, but 
no chest pain pressure currently. She does feel very hot to 
touch but otherwise does not report any cough or recent fevers. 
She endorsed dysuria and urinary frequency, but no nausea or 
vomiting, no abdominal pain. She did take her current dose of 
metoprolol in the morning prior to arrival.

Of note, the patient was recently seen by her cardiologist 2 
days ago. While there, her heart rate was in the ___, so her 
metoprolol dose was not increased despite patient being more 
symptomatic over the past few days.

In the ED, initial vitals: T 98.6, HR 118, BP 155/100, RR 18, O2 
sat 99% on RA. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid 
ventricular response, RBBB. Labs/studies notable for WBC 4.1, 
Hgb 11.4, INR 1.2, AST 73, ALT 45, alk phos 175, Cr 0.8, 
troponin-T <0.01, lactate 1.0. CXR showed cardiomegaly, 
congestion and mild interstitial edema. Patient was given 
metoprolol tartrate 5 mg IV and 25 mg po, NS 500 mL with 
improvement in ventricular rates to 100s-120s. Vitals on 
transfer: T 98.3, VR 113, BP 143/91, RR 17, O2 sat 99% on RA.

After arrival to the cardiology ward, the patient stated that 
she is still having intermittent palpitations, but is otherwise 
doing fine now. She did not report fevers, chills, chest pain, 
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
changes in bowel or bladder habits. Of note, the patient has 
been having night sweats over the past several weeks.

___ Cardiovascular ECHO   
The patient exercised for 9 minutes and 0 seconds according to a 
Modified ___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart 
rate of 141 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 200/96 mmHg. The 
test was stopped because of fatigue and lower left leg pain. 
This level of exercise represents a fair to average exercise 
tolerance for age and gender. In response to stress, the ECG 
showed non-specific ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for 
details). There is resting mild hypertension with normal blood 
pressure and heart rate responses to stress. 

Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 77 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis/near-akinesis 
of the inferior and inferlateral segments and hypokinesis of the 
basal inferoseptal wall. The remaining segments contracted well 
(LVEF = 35-40 %). Normal right ventricular cavity size with free 
wall hypokinesis. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler 
demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with no aortic stenosis, 
aortic regurgitation or significant resting LVOT gradient. 

Echo images were acquired within 27 seconds after peak stress at 
a heart rate of 138 bpm. These demonstrated no new regional wall 
motion abnormalities. Baseline abnormalities persist with 
appropriate augmentation of other segments. The right ventricle 
contracted vigorously.

IMPRESSION: Fair to average functional exercise capacity for age 
and gender. Non-specific ECG changes in the absence of 2D 
echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved 
workload. Prior myocardial infarction. Resting hypertension. 
Normal hemodynamic response to exercise.

atypical 
chest discomfort after being found to be in atrial flutter with 
RVR and 
mild troponin elevation. The patient completed 9 minutes of a 
modified 
___ protocol representing a fair/average exercise tolerance 
for his 
age; ~ ___ METS. Exercise was stopped due to fatigue and lower 
left leg 
discomfort; leg claudication. No chest, back, neck or arm 
discomforts 
were reported. In the presence of atrial flutter, 0.5-1 mm 
upsloping ST 
segment depression was noted inferolaterally. At rest, the 
rhythm was 
atrial flutter with variable block with heart rate ~ 60-70 bpm. 
Early in 
exercise (2 minutes into exercise), atrial flutter with 2:1 
block was 
noted with heart rate ~ 140 bpm and remained at that rate 
throughout the 
remainder of exercise. Frequent isolated VPBs were noted and 
rare 
ventricular couplets. The blood pressure response to exercise 
was 
appropriate. 
  
IMPRESSION: Fair/average exercise tolerance with exercise 
terminated 
secondary to left lower leg discomfort; claudication. No anginal 

symptoms with nonspecific ST segment changes. Rhythm was atrial 
flutter 
with 2:1 block and heart rates of 140s noted early in exercise.

History of Present Illness:
HPI(4): Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who is admitted to the
medical floor on a ___ for paranoia and agitation, being
treated for a urinary tract infection. Earlier today, ___ was in
the hospital visiting her sister who had just had surgery. ___
tells me that she was ""just so worried"" about her sister and got
in an altercation with the surgical team, and a ""Code Purple"" 
was
called. She was therefore placed on a ___ and sent to the
emergency room. In the ED, laboratory work up showed a UA c/w a
UTI. Both psychiatry and neurology were consulted. Neurology
recommended a lumbar puncture in the ED to evaluate for a
subacute meningoencephalitis. Psych stated that the patient did
not have the ability to make her own medical decisions, and
recommended treating of her UTI prior to further evaluation. She
was given a dose of IV ceftriaxone. The ED team spoke with both
the neurological and psychiatric team and decided to defer LP
given other likely diagnosis, and difficulty performing in a
patient who would not consent. She received several doses of
olanzapine IM for agitation.

On arrival to the floor, ___ was calm and gives a clear history.
She told me what happened above. Over the past several days, she
denies any urinary symptoms -- no dysuria, polyuria, or burning
on urination. She denies any headaches, fevers, chills, changes
in bowel habits. She denies any agitation, though tells me she
has been very anxious, especially about her sister. She denies
any joint pains, neck stiffness, vision changes. She does tell 
me
that around ___, she had what appeared to be a tickbite --
she allowed the insect to stay there for three days before it
fell off, and there was a ~1cm red lesion in that spot. She was
never tested or treated for Lyme disease. No joint pains. She 
ran
out of her thyroid medication last week, and had not yet picked
up her refill -- went a total of a week without medications.

I also spoke with her PCP on the phone. He has not had any
concerns about ___'s mental status (though was very concerned
about her sister). Tells me they have no family support, but 
that
he hadn't noticed anything otherwise wrong.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All
other systems were reviewed and are negative.

1. Hypothyroidism
2. HLD
3. Mild cognitive impairment (has never had a neurocognitive 
evaluation)

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old woman with untreated SLE who was
 transferred to the ___ ED via medflight from ___
 ___ after a cardiac arrest. Per report, the patient was
 found after a low-speed MVC after her car rolled up over a curb
 and hit a granite mailbox. When police arrived she was
 unresponsive and pulseless so AED was applied, shock was
 indicated, and she was shocked with ROSC after 1 shock. Her
 pupils were noted to be pinpoint so she received narcan without
 effect. There was a question of seizure activity/decorticate
 posturing and she was altered by the time she arrived at the 
OSH
 so she was intubated with etomidate/rocuronium and given Keppra
 and started on fentanyl and propofol. ECG reportedly showed
 lateral ST depressions but she remained hemodynamically stable.
 On arrival to ___ she had CT scans that showed no head or 
neck
 fracture or hemorrhage. Her repeat ECG showed no evidence of
 STEMI. Her initial labs revealed a leukocytosis with WBC 15.1,
 normal hemoglobin, mildly elevated transaminases, troponin
 elevated to 0.18, normal renal function and unremarkable
 electrolytes. Her basic toxicology was negative. Per her 
family,
 in the days and weeks leading up to this event she had 
described
 no new physical complaints other than mild right arm pain and
 some pleuritic right chest wall discomfort, with no complaints
of chest pressure, dyspnea, palpitations, lightheadedness, or
 syncope. She has not seen a doctor in over ___ years.

Upon arrival to ___, the patient was noted to have the
following:   

In the ED, initial vitals were:  
 97.2 108 119/63 22 100% intubated 
  
 - Exam notable for: 
 Primary survey was unremarkable.  Her secondary survey was
notable for GCS 3 T.

- Labs notable for:  
 -leukocytosis to 15, ALT 240, AST 284, Trop 0.18

- Imaging was notable for:
 -rib fractures from CPR or MVC 
 -EKG with STD 

She was seen by the post arrest team who recommended TTM if
patient not following commands off sedation with goal 
temperature
of 36C for 48h.  

Trauma surgery evaluated the patient and did not think there was
any traumatic injuries. 

- Patient was given:   
nothing  
 
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient is intubated but having
decordicate posturing and noted to have tongue biting and rapid
eye movement and given 2mg Ativan.    

Review of systems was negative except as detailed above.

IMAGING:
========
EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of diffuse background slowing indicative of a 
moderate encephalopathy, nonspecific as to etiology. Medication 
effects, toxic/metabolic disturbances and/or infection are among 
the most common causes. There are two pushbutton activation for 
unclear reason. There are no electrographic seizures. 

CT C-spine ___. No definite fracture or traumatic alignment abnormality. 
2. Subtle anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 likely chronic though in 
the absence of priors clinical correlation advised. 
3. Subtle punctate hyperdensity anterior to the superior 
endplate of C5, 
likely chronic.  No definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  
Evaluation somewhat limited given intubated state.  Please 
correlate clinically. 

CT head ___
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.

CT chest/abd/pelvis ___. Subtle fat stranding along the right renal pelvis and 
proximal ureter may reflect blood products without definite 
evidence of injury to the collecting system. 
2. Minimally displaced fractures of the anterior left 6 and ___ 
ribs. 
3. Posterior dependent opacities in the lungs likely 
atelectasis, with 
possible component of aspiration. 
4. ET tube positioned 1.6 cm above the carina.  ___ consider 
slight retraction for more optimal positioning. 
5. Fibroid uterus. 

Lower-extremity US ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall
thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. The
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with 
depressed free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter

is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with mild posterior leaflet systolic prolapse. There
is an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild [1+] mitral 
regurgitation. Due to the Coanda effect, the severity
of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal.
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.

MRI Brain ___
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, 
midline shift or infarction.   The ventricles and sulci are 
normal in caliber and 
configuration.  The major intracranial flow voids are preserved. 
 The sphenoid sinus is opacified.  There is mild-to-moderate 
mucosal thickening of the remaining paranasal sinuses. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Normal study 

Corornary angiogram ___
No angiographically significant coronary artery disease.

EP Procedure Note ___

TTE ___
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
55-60%. The right ventricle has normal free wall motion. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. 
The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with mild posterior leaflet 
systolic prolapse. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trivial residual pericardial effuion. Normal 
biventricular systolic function. Mild posterior MVP.",10,"Cardiac arrest, cause unspecified",MED

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female presented to ___ ED with ongoing back pain,
parasthesia, and new urinary retention. She is closely followed
by her PCP for ___ of back pain for past several
months. 

The patient reports that the initial onset of symptoms for her
was in ___ and was mostly upper back pain. She was 
initially
treated with cyclobenzaprine and physical therapy.  However, 
when
she was seen in follow-up in ___, she reported ongoing
back pain and new parasthesias. Her PCP ordered an MRI of the
thoracic and lumbar spine which she underwent on ___. This
revealed a 1.5 cm extramedullary intradural mass in the right
ventral T2 spinal canal, demonstrating homogeneous enhancement
and suggestion of dural tails, resulting in severe flattening of
the cord, as well as severe spinal canal narrowing at L4-L5
secondary to degenerative changes. 

She was therefore referred to the ___ spine clinic by her PCP.
The patient has an upcoming appointment on ___, however, the
pain and paresthesias are worsening and she describes a recent
development of an inability to completely empty her bladder x 1
week. Therefore, she presented to urgent care and was
subsequently sent to ___ ED for evaluation.
