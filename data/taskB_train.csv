INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SAH, ___ aneurysm// possible embo
ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia was maintained by separate
anesthesia provider throughout the entirety of the case.The anesthesia
provider also monitored the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory parameters.

TECHNIQUE:  Patient was brought into the angio suite, ID was confirmed via
wrist band.The patient was placed supine on fluoroscopy table and bilateral
groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Time-out procedure
was performed per institutional guidelines. The location of the right mid
femoral head was located using anatomic and radiographic landmarks.  10 +10 cc
of subcutaneous lidocaine was infused into the tissue.  Micropuncture kit was
used to gain access to the right femoral artery, serial dilation was
undertaken until a long 8 ___ groin sheath connected to a continuous
heparinized saline flush could be inserted. ___ catheter was
connected to the power injector and also to a continuous heparinized saline
flush. This was advanced over the 0.038 glidewire brought up the aorta used to
select the right internal carotid artery.  AP and lateral views of the
anterior cerebral circulation were obtained.  Subsequently, 3D rotational
images were performed requiring post processing on an independent workstation
under concurrent physician supervision and used in the interpretation and
reporting of the procedure.

Catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and used to select the left
internal carotid artery. AP, and lateral views of the anterior cerebral
circulation were obtained. The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and
the left subclavian artery was selected. AP and lateral road map imaging was
undertaken.  Next, the left vertebral artery was selected. AP and lateral
views were taken from this vessel for the posterior cerebral circulation.

All angio runs were medically necessary for baseline assessment and for future
comparison as there was no previous catheter based angiogram.

Under constant fluoroscopy, using an angled Glidewire exchange, the diagnostic
catheter was exchanged to .088  90cm Straight Neuron Cath., which was advanced
to satisfactory position in the right internal carotid artery. The Glidewire
was removed, a new AP and lateral road maps were obtained, then SL 10 micro
catheter was advanced carefully and slowly over a synchro 2 wire until its was
positioned halfway into the aneurysm.  A 4mm/15mm Scepter Balloon was also
mounted and kept in the petrous segment of the ICA.

Target  360 Ultra 2.5mm/4cm Coil was used as a framing coil, which was
advanced slowly and carefully until it was fully deployed inside the aneurysm,
before final detachment an angio run was done confirming patency of the ICA
territory.  Subsequently, we continued deploying a more coils until we reached
satisfactory obliteration of the aneurysm

After the deployment of the last coil, the micro catheter was pulled out, then
we obtained final AP and lateral views, which confirmed the patency of all
involved arteries and a satisfactory obliteration of the aneurysm.

The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta fully removed from the body.  A
common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a closure device,
subsequently 8 ___ Angio-Seal was put in. At the conclusion of the
procedure, there is no evidence of thromboembolic complication and the patient
was transferred back to the neuro ICU in stable condition.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia was maintained by separate
anesthesia provider throughout the entirety of the case.The anesthesia
provider also monitored the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory parameters.

TECHNIQUE:

Patient was brought into the angio suite, ID was confirmed via wrist band.The
patient was placed supine on fluoroscopy table and bilateral groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Time-out procedure was
performed per institutional guidelines. The location of the right mid femoral
head was located using anatomic and radiographic landmarks.  10 cc of
subcutaneous lidocaine was infused into the tissue.  Micropuncture kit was
used to gain access to the right femoral artery, serial dilation was
undertaken until a long 6 ___ groin sheath connected to a continuous
heparinized saline flush could be inserted. ___ catheter was
connected to the power injector and also to a continuous heparinized saline
flush. This was advanced over the 0.035 glidewire brought up the aorta used to
select the left common carotid artery. AP, oblique and lateral views of the
anterior cerebral circulation were obtained .

The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and the left subclavian artery
was selected. AP road map imaging was undertaken.  Next, the ostia of the left
vertebral artery was cannulate. AP and lateral views were taken from this
vessel for the posterior cerebral circulation but it was of a poor quality. 
Due to that, The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and used to select
the right subclavian artery, under road map guidance the right vertebral
artery was cannulated and AP and lateral views of the posterior cerebral
circulation were obtained.

The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and used to select the right
internal carotid artery under road maps guidance. AP, oblique and lateral
views of the anterior cerebral circulation were obtained .  Subsequently, 3D
rotational images were performed requiring post processing on an independent
workstation under concurrent physician supervision and used in the
interpretation and reporting of the procedure.

In collaboration with our colleagues anesthesia, ___ units of heparin were
given to target ACT between 250 and 300 subsequent doses were given as needed
to achieve this target.

Under constant fluoroscopy, using an angled Glidewire exchange, the diagnostic
catheter was exchanged to Benchmark catheter, which was advanced to
satisfactory position in the internal carotid artery. The Glidewire was
removed, a new AP and lateral road maps were obtained and were used as working
views, then SL 10 micro catheter was advanced carefully and slowly over a
synchro 2 wire until its was positioned halfway into the aneurysm.

Target 3D 3mm/6cm Coil was used as a framing coil, which was advanced slowly
and carefully until it created a nice basket below the origin of the PCOM
inside the aneurysm, this coil was not detached and was kept as a framing coil
until the end of the coiling procedure.

 then a second SL 10 micro catheter was advanced carefully and slowly over a
synchro 2 wire until its was positioned halfway into the framing coil, then we
started deploying coils slowly and carefully until we reached satisfactory
obliteration of the aneurysm, intermittent angio runs were utilized between
the coiling sessions.

Before final detachment of the framing coil an angio run was done .

After the deployment of the last coil, the micro catheters was pulled out,
then we obtained final AP and lateral views.

A right common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a closure
device, subsequently Angio-Seal was put in.

Before patient extubation, we were reviewing the angio runs and we noticed an
area of decreased opacity at the proximal A2 on the right side that raised our
suspicion of a clot formation Vs competing non contrasted blood flow from the
contralateral side, there was no flow limitation in the ACA territory. 
Despite that we immediately puncture the left side and did a new angiogram of
the right internal carotid followed by 3D rotational images were performed
requiring post processing on an independent workstation under concurrent
physician supervision and used in the interpretation and reporting of the
procedure.  that showed full perfusion of the ACA/MCA/PCOM territories but
still there was an area of suspicious hypo densities of the proximal A2, due
to that we decided to treat with intra-arterially integrilin calculated per
weight.  We also did the left internal carotid artery angiogram that showed
the full patency of the anterior circulation with some cross-filling to the
contralateral A2 via the A-comm.

Final right internal carotid artery AP/oblique and lateral views were obtained
approximately 20 min after intra-arterially integralin injection that showed
full perfusion of the ACA/MCA/PCOM territories and no flow limitation with the
same area of suspicious hypo densities of the proximal A2.  We decided not to
further treat that and extubated the patient.

A left common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a closure
device, subsequently Angio-Seal was put in.

FINDINGS: 

Compared to the recent prior radiographs, retrocardiac opacity has seems to
have improved and pleural effusions have decreased.

A large bore venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.

Heart is normal in size.  There is calcification among coronary arteries as
well as the mitral and aortic valves.  Right-sided pleural effusion is small,
left is also small but somewhat larger than on the right side.  Calcified
pleural plaques are present bilaterally, which are all very often due to,
particularly when diffuse and bilateral, prior asbestos exposure. There is no
pericardial effusion.  No lymphadenopathy is found in the chest.

Lungs show moderate emphysema.  There is a patchy non nodular opacity at the
right lung apex for which a minor inflammatory process is favored.  There is
mild peripheral reticulation which is seen in diffuse fashion within each
lung, but not highly extensive, likely a mild chronic interstitial
abnormality. There is no ground glass or honeycombing. There are no

During the procedure the following vessels were selectively catheterized
angiograms performed:

Left common carotid artery

Left vertebral artery

Right internal carotid artery

 Three-dimensional rotational angiography of the right internal carotid artery
circulation requiring post processing on an independent workstation and
concurrent attending physician interpretation and review

Right internal carotid artery after pipeline placement

Right internal carotid artery after coiling

Right common femoral artery

INDICATION:  This is a ___ female who presented with history of blurry
vision and burning eye pain of the right.  CTA was concerning for large right
ICA aneurysm.  She was felt to be candidate for pipeline and coiling.  The
purpose of the coils was since she was having some symptoms in the right eye
destabilized the aneurysm in case there was acute changes.  She was loaded on
brilinta and aspirin prior to coming to the angio suite.
ANESTHESIA:  The patient was maintained under general endotracheal anesthesia.
Please see separately dictated anesthesia documentation.  The patient's
hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were monitored continuously throughout
the entirety of the case by a trained and independent observer.

TECHNIQUE:  Pipeline embolization+ coils of unruptured aneurysm

COMPARISON:  CTA outside hospital

PROCEDURE:   The patient was identified and brought to the neuro radiology
suite.  She was transferred to the fluoroscopic table supine.  After smooth
induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, bilateral groins were prepped
and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A time-out was performed.  The right
common femoral artery was identified using anatomic and radiographic
landmarks.  The right common femoral artery was accessed using standard
micropuncture technique after infiltration of local anesthetic.  A long 8
___ sheath was introduced, connected to continuous heparinized saline
flush, and secured.

 Next a ___ diagnostic catheter was introduced.  It was connected to
continuous heparinized saline flush as well as the power injector.  It was
advanced over 038 glidewire through the aorta into the aortic arch.  The wire
was used to select the left common carotid artery.  The catheter was
positioned over the wire into the left common carotid artery.  The wire was
removed.  Vessel patency was confirmed via hand injection.  Standard AP and
lateral as well as high magnification oblique views were obtained.

The catheter was withdrawn to the aortic arch.  The wire was introduced and
used to select the left vertebral artery.  The catheter was positioned over
the wire into the left vertebral artery.  The wire was removed.  Vessel
patency was confirmed via hand injection.  Standard AP and lateral views were
obtained.

Catheter was withdrawn to the aortic arch.  The wire was introduced and used
to select the right internal carotid artery.  The catheter was positioned over
the wire into the right internal carotid artery.  The wire was removed. 
Vessel patency was confirmed via hand injection.  Standard AP and lateral as
well as three-dimensional rotational images were obtained.

Patient was loaded with 5000 units of IV heparin.  Baseline and serial aCTs
were obtained and the patient was re-dose as necessary in order to maintain a
level above 250.

 The purpose of the diagnostic angiograms was to provide baseline images for
comparison to runs later in the case to rule out thromboembolic complications
as well as understand collateral flow and rule out additional aneurysms.  They
were also used for selection of devices as well as working angles.  The
diagnostic portion informed the interventional portion that followed.

Roadmap was performed.  Exchange length Glidewire was advanced into the right
internal carotid artery.  The diagnostic catheter was exchanged off and a
flushed and prepared neuron max guide catheter was positioned within the right
internal carotid artery.  The internal dilator and exchange length wire were
removed.  Catheter was double flushed and connected to continuous heparinized
saline flush as well as the power injector.  Vessel patency was confirmed via
hand injection.  Fresh roadmap was performed.  It was then appreciated that
the necessary catheters 4 plate coiling and pipeline placement would not fit
within the neuron max by 0.01 inches.  For this reason the exchange length
wire was again next advanced into the internal carotid artery.  The neuron max
was exchanged off as was the sheath.  Next a 7 ___ Cook shuttle sheath was
exchanged into position.  This was done without a groin sheath.  The internal
dilator and exchange length wire were removed.  The catheter was double
flushed and connected to continuous heparinized saline as well as power
injector.  Vessel patency was confirmed via hand injection.  A fresh roadmap
was performed.  The guide catheter was connected to ___

Next an 044 DAC was introduced into the side-port of the ___ over a female
microcatheter loaded with a synchro 2 standard wire.  Microwire was advanced
to the right MCA.  The catheter was positioned over the wire into the right
MCA.  The microwire was removed.  The microcatheter was connected to
continuous heparinized saline flush.

Through the middle port of the W 2 we a straight SL 10 microcatheter was
introduced with a synchro 2 standard wire.  This was used to navigate into the
aneurysm.  Once this was achieved the microwire was removed.  And this
microcatheter was also connected to continuous heparinized saline flush.

A 4.5 x 20 mm pipeline device was selected.  It was pre deployed ___ and
recaptured.  It was introduced into the rotating hemostatic valve and allowed
to flush.  It was loaded to the tip of the microcatheter.  The tip coil was
pushed out.  The ___ mm of the device were deployed within the MCA.  The
device was pulled back and positioned across the neck of the aneurysm and
fully deployed.  Hand injection was performed a the right internal carotid
artery through the guide catheter.  Next microcatheter was advanced through
the stent to recapture the tip coil.  Next the microwire into coil were
removed.  The intermediate catheter remained in place.

Next attention was turned to coiling the aneurysm.  2 XL coils were placed via
the SL 10 catheter that had been jail due in the aneurysm.  Intermittent
angiograms were performed to confirm vessel patency and device positioning. 
The final coil was detached.  The microcatheter was removed.  The DAC
intermediate catheter was removed.  Final AP and lateral views were obtained
via the guide catheter in the right internal carotid artery to rule out
thromboembolic complications and assess device positioning.

Next the guide catheter was removed.  The 7 ___ shuttle sheath was
withdrawn to the lower aorta.  Right common femoral angiogram was performed
via hand injection through the sheath.  The sheath was removed and the
arteriotomy was closed using a 6 ___ Perclose.  After waking from general
endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was removed from the fluoroscopy table
and remained at her neurologic baseline without any evidence of thromboembolic
complications.

course to the level of the ureterovesical junction measuring up to 10 mm. 
There is no left-sided obstruction.  There is no perinephric abnormality.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  There are multiple prominent
loops of small bowel in the upper abdomen measuring up to 3.5 cm in maximal
diameter.  Mid to distal small bowel loops in the left and central lower
abdomen demonstrate circumferential wall thickening and evidence of submucosal
fatty infiltration (series 601, image 29).  There is mild congestion of the
small bowel mesentery at this level.  Similar changes are noted in the
terminal ileum.  Bowel wall enhancement is preserved.  There is no evidence of
a mechanical bowel obstruction.  Oral contrast has passed into distal small
bowel and proximal colon.  There is mild thickening of the cecum and ascending
colon.  Transverse, descending and proximal sigmoid colon are unremarkable. 
Distal sigmoid colon is collapsed.  There is however close proximity of the
rectosigmoid junction to the right posterolateral urinary bladder (series 2,

sidewall, the right lateral urinary bladder wall and right perivesicular fat
measuring 6 x 8 x 5.7 cm (AP x TR x CC).  The mass extends to the right
ureterovesicular junction.  There is involvement of the bladder neck.  This
mass extends in a contiguous fashion from the superior pubic ramus on the
right, the underlying bony structures are abnormal in appearance with new
increased sclerosis when compared to the prior study.

There is small amount of free fluid within the pelvis and upper abdomen.  No
peritoneal nodules identified.

REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:
The prostate is not enlarged.  Abnormal soft tissue density is seen along the
anterior aspect of the prostate gland toward the apex which may be involved by
the large infiltrative pelvic mass.
In addition, there is a large right-sided hydrocele.

is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild atherosclerotic disease
is noted.

BONES:
There is soft tissue calcification likely reflecting aggressive periosteal new
bone formation along the deep surface of the right iliac crest with thinning
of the underlying cortex which appears mottled with probable extraosseous soft
tissue extending beneath the iliacus muscle.  Sclerotic changes are noted
within the right superior acetabulum which may be related to prior radiation. 
Note is made of a biopsy tract within the right superior acetabulum. There are
ill-defined lytic and sclerotic foci within the right superior pubic ramus
with mottled appearance of the cortex.  The above described infiltrative
pelvic mass abuts the right superior pubic ramus.
Note is also made of an ill-defined sclerotic lesion within the L4 vertebral
body.

SOFT TISSUES: There is asymmetric thickening of the right pectineus muscle.","IMPRESSION:


1. Large infiltrative pelvic mass involving the right lateral urinary bladder
and lower anterior pelvic sidewall as described abuts and likely arises from
the right superior pubic ramus.  This may represent local progression of
patient's known right iliac Ewing sarcoma, correlation with prior imaging and
oncology history is recommended.  Radiation-induced sarcoma can also be
considered given patient's age. MRI of the pelvis is recommended to better
evaluate extent of bone and soft tissue involvement.
2. There is involvement of the right ureterovesicular junction causing mild
right hydroureteronephrosis.
3. 15 mm pulmonary nodule in the lingula and a 10 mm pleural based nodule in
the left lateral lower lobe are new when compared to the prior study and
highly concerning for intrathoracic metastatic disease.
4. Ill-defined sclerotic lesion within the L4 vertebral body may be radiation
induced osteitis or represent metastatic disease.  Correlation with patient's
radiotherapy history is recommended.
5. No evidence of bowel obstruction.  Distal small bowel wall thickening and
submucosal fatty infiltration are most likely a sequela of the chronic
inflammation, possibly radiation enteritis.

FINDINGS: 

CERVICAL:
Corresponding to the same-day cervical spine CT examination, there is
identification of an obliquely orientated fracture line involving the anterior
and superior endplates of the C6 vertebral body extending to a large C5-C6
anterior osteophyte, though the fracture line appears relatively well
corticated on the prior CT and is likely not chronic with associated
prevertebral soft tissue edema extending from the levels of C3-C4 through the
T2-T3 level (3:8).  There is some mild irregularity of the anterior
longitudinal ligament from the levels of C5 through C7 (03:11), though without
discrete tear, which may represent ligamentous injury.  Vertebral body
alignment is preserved.  Vertebral body heights are otherwise preserved. 
There is no evidence of other ligamentous injury.

There is type ___ ___ endplate degenerative change at C6-C7.  There is
otherwise no focal bone marrow signal abnormality.

There is loss of T2 signal of the intervertebral discs, a manifestation of
degenerative disc disease.  There is mild disc height loss at C5-C6 and C6-C7.

There is a roughly 15 mm stretch of T2/water IDEAL hyperintensity at the level
of C3-C4 where there is spinal cord compression by a disc bulge and ligamentum
flavum thickening appearing to affect the entire transverse dimension of the
cord, representing either edema or myelomalacia.  The remainder of the
cervical spinal cord appears preserved in signal and caliber.

The spinal canal appears congenitally narrowed by short pedicles, contributing
to spinal canal narrowing at all levels.

At C2-C3, there is a central disc protrusion and ligamentum flavum thickening
producing superimposed mild spinal canal narrowing with ventral flattening of
the cord.  Facet and uncovertebral osteophytes produce mild left neural
foraminal narrowing.  The right neural foramen is patent.

At C3-C4, there is moderate disc bulge and central protrusion along with
ligamentum flavum thickening is severely narrowing the spinal canal with cord
compression and underlying cord signal abnormality.  Facet and uncovertebral
osteophytes produce severe left and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.

At C4-C5, central disc protrusion and ligamentum flavum thickening produce
superimposed mild spinal canal narrowing.  Facet and uncovertebral osteophytes
produce mild left-greater-than-right neural foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7, disc protrusion centrally and slightly to the left of midline
produce mild superimposed spinal canal narrowing with flattening of the
ventral cord.  Facet and uncovertebral osteophytes produce mild bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7, disc bulge and endplate osteophytes produce mild superimposed spinal
canal narrowing.  Facet and endplate osteophytes produce severe left and
moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.

At C7-T1, disc bulge, facet osteophytes and ligamentum flavum thickening
produce moderate superimposed spinal canal narrowing.  Facet and uncovertebral
osteophytes produce severe left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.

THORACIC:
Alignment is normal.Vertebral body heights are preserved.  Multiple small
Schmorl's nodes are seen, mainly in the lower thoracic spine.  There is no
focal bone marrow signal abnormality.  There is mild loss of T2 signal of the
intervertebral discs, a manifestation of degenerative disc disease.  The
intervertebral disc heights are otherwise relatively well preserved. The
spinal cord appears normal in caliber and configuration.  Facet and endplate
osteophytes produce mild neural foraminal narrowing at multiple levels.  There
is no significant spinal canal or high-grade neural foraminal narrowing.

LUMBAR:
Vertebral body alignment is preserved.Vertebral body heights are preserved. 
Schmorl's nodes are seen at multiple levels.  There is no focal bone marrow
signal abnormality. The spinal cord appears normal in caliber and
configuration.  The conus medullaris terminates at the mid T12 level.   There
is no evidence of infection or neoplasm.  There is loss of T2 signal of the
intervertebral discs, a manifestation of degenerative disc disease.  The
intervertebral disc heights are otherwise relatively well preserved.

At T12-L1, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

At L1-L2, trace disc bulge and endplate osteophytes indent the ventral thecal
sac without significant spinal canal narrowing.  The neural foramina are
patent.

At L2-L3, disc bulge and ligamentum flavum thickening produce mild spinal
canal narrowing.  There is effacement of the subarticular zones with possible
compression of the traversing bilateral L3 nerve roots.  Facet and endplate
osteophytes produce minimal bilateral neural foraminal narrowing

At L3-L4, disc bulge and ligamentum flavum thickening produce mild spinal
canal narrowing.  There is effacement of the subarticular zones with contact
of the traversing bilateral L4 nerve roots without definite compression. 
Facet and endplate osteophytes produce minimal bilateral neural foraminal
narrowing.

At L4-L5, there is trace disc bulge without significant spinal canal
narrowing.  There is effacement of the subarticular zones with possible
compression of the traversing bilateral L5 nerve roots, greater on the left
(12:34).  Facet and endplate osteophytes produce mild bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing

FINDINGS: 

CERVICAL:

There is no evidence of vertebral body height loss within the cervical spine. 
There is minimal, 1-2 mm of retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 and C6 on C7. The bone
marrow signal is normal.

There is a background of minimal congenital cervical spinal canal narrowing,
which combines with degenerative changes as follows:

C1-C2, C2-C3: There is no definite spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal
narrowing.

C3-C4: There is a minimal posterior disc bulge which results in mild canal
stenosis with uncovertebral joint hypertrophy resulting in moderate bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing.

C4-C5: A posterior disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac resulting in
mild-to-moderate canal stenosis with moderate bilateral neural foraminal
narrowing.

C5-C6: A posterior disc bulge results in moderate canal stenosis with mild
right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing.

C6-C7: A posterior disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac resulting in
moderate canal stenosis with uncovertebral joint hypertrophy resulting in mild
right and mild-to-moderate left neural foraminal narrowing.

C7-T1: There is a minimal disc bulge at this level with no significant canal
stenosis and with mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  Small bilateral
perineural cysts are seen.


THORACIC SPINE:
There is a severe compression fracture involving the T7 vertebral body with
mild increased STIR signal, which may reflect a subacute fracture.  No
significant bony retrolisthesis or retropulsion is seen at this level. The
remainder of the thoracic vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height.

The sagittal spinal alignment is grossly maintained.  There is no suspicious
bone marrow signal identified.

A mild posterior disc bulge is seen at T7-T8 which indents the ventral thecal
sac resulting in mild canal stenosis.  Otherwise, no significant spondylosis
is seen within the thoracic spine.


LUMBAR:
There is an acute appearing fracture with severe compression of the L1
vertebral body, with approximately 4 mm of bony retropulsion of the largest
fracture fragment.  This results in mild thecal sac indentation and canal
stenosis at this level, with patent neural foramina bilaterally.

Otherwise, the remainder of the lumbar vertebral bodies demonstrate normal
height and alignment. There is no concerning focal bone marrow signal
abnormality. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of L1.

There is a small posterior disc bulge at L5-S1 with no canal stenosis and mild
left neural foraminal narrowing.  Of note, the disc bulge at this level
minimally contacts the exiting left L5 nerve root.  A left-sided perineural
cyst is also noted at this level.  Otherwise, minimal posterior disc bulging
at L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 are seen without significant canal stenosis or neural

COMPARISON:  Unenhanced head CT ___ performed at 17:11.

FINDINGS: 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
Centered within the frontal interhemispheric fissure, there is acute
subarachnoid hemorrhage, tracking along the expected course of the anterior
cerebral arteries bilaterally.  Surrounding medial parafalcine frontal lobe
hypodensity likely reflects parenchymal edema.  This edema extends into the
corpus callosum.  More small volume acute subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen
within the anterior aspect of the suprasellar cistern, and layering
dependently in the left sylvian fissure (02:16).  A small amount of
subarachnoid blood is present diffusely throughout the left hemisphere,
obscuring the sulci.

There is a chronic infarct in the right cerebellum.

There is no evidence of acute infarction or mass.  Mild mass-effect due to 
edema causes minimal deformation of the frontal horn of the right lateral
ventricle.  No herniation or entrapment.

Background ventricular and sulcal caliber is mildly prominent consistent with
global parenchymal volume loss.  Carotid siphon calcifications are noted
bilaterally.

Nasal bone fractures are noted bilaterally, age indeterminate (2:6).  The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids appear clear.  Aside from right lens
extraction, the globes and orbits are within normal limits.

CTA HEAD:
Arising from the right aspect of the anterior communicating artery is an
anteriorly projecting 6 mm apex to base, 4 mm in diameter, 3 mm at the neck
saccular aneurysm (3:257, 63:18).

Mild luminal narrowing, distal V3 vertebral artery segment (3:197), likely due
to underlying atheromatous plaque.  V4 vertebral artery segments are patent
bilaterally with areas of mild-to-moderate luminal narrowing, likely due to
underlying atheromatous plaque.

Smooth mild luminal narrowing of the distal basilar artery is noted, possibly
due to underlying atheromatous plaque.  There is a fetal type right PCA with a
patent right posterior communicating artery.  The right P1 segment of the
posterior cerebral artery is not well seen.  The P2 and more distal bilateral
posterior cerebral artery branches appear widely patent with preserved distal
runoff.

Calcified and noncalcified atheromatous plaque affecting the cavernous and
supraclinoid intracranial internal carotid arteries bilaterally causes severe
left supraclinoid ICA luminal narrowing (3:247), and moderate right
intracranial ICA luminal narrowing.  No large vessel occlusion.  Left carotid
terminus is patent.  Left A1 ACA not well seen, either diminutive or
developmentally absent.

 Otherwise, the remaining portions of the bilateral intracranial internal
carotid arteries and the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries are
patent with preserved distal runoff.

 Major dural venous sinuses appear patent.

CTA NECK:
Calcified plaque at the left and right carotid bulbs does not cause luminal
narrowing by NASCET criteria.  Minimal luminal irregularity of the distal left
extracranial ICA is likely due to atheromatous disease.  The remainder of the
left and right cervical carotid arteries are widely patent.

Severe, near occlusive luminal narrowing of the V1 segment in the proximal V2
segment of the right vertebral artery is noted, likely due to underlying
atheromatous plaque.  The vessel regains normal caliber at the mid V2 segment,
widely patent distal to this the level of the skullbase, with slight
background luminal irregularity which likely represents underlying
atheromatous disease.

The left vertebral artery arises separately from the aortic arch, a normal
anatomic variant.  The left cervical vertebral artery is widely patent and
unremarkable throughout its visualized course.

Mild calcified plaque at the aortic arch.  Arch branch vessel origins are
widely patent.

OTHER:
There are severe cervical spine degenerative changes with marked focal
cervical spine kyphosis centered at approximately C5.  No aggressive focal
osseous lesions.  There are severe bilateral temporomandibular joint
degenerative changes.  No cervical adenopathy.  No suspicious pulmonary nodule
in the partially visualized lung apices.","IMPRESSION:


1. Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage centered primarily in the frontal
interhemispheric fissure tracking along the expected course of the anterior

communicating artery.
3. Patent cervical vessels, however with severe luminal narrowing of the V1
and proximal V2 segments of the right cervical vertebral artery, irregular but
patent distal to this; appearance most likely due to chronic underlying
atheromatous plaque, however age indeterminate dissection is difficult to
fully exclude.
4. Scattered areas of intracranial arterial narrowing due to atheromatous

evidence of abnormal or disc signal.  No epidural collection.  No prevertebral
collection.  The visualized posterior fossa is unremarkable.  There is no cord
signal abnormality.

C2-C3: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

C3-C4: Small central protrusion does not significantly narrow the spinal
canal.  Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy results in mild
left-greater-than-right neural foraminal narrowing.

C4-C5: A small central protrusion results in mild spinal canal narrowing. 
Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy results in moderate right and mild left
neural foraminal narrowing.

C5-C6: A central protrusion with thickening of the ligamentum flavum results
in moderate spinal canal narrowing, without remodeling the cord. 
Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy results in likely severe bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing.

C6-C7: Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy results in mild bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing.  A small left eccentric protrusion does not significantly
narrow the spinal canal.

C7-T1: No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

There is T2/STIR hyperintense signal along the level for cervical lymph nodes

7. Post embolization superior rectal artery angiogram
8. Post embolization inferior mesenteric artery angiogram

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the
procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient
was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table.
A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol. Both groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was
punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. A
0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was
made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and a
___ wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture
sheath was exchanged for a 5 ___ sheath which was attached to a continuous
heparinized saline side arm flush.

A ___ catheter was advanced over a Glidewire wire into the aorta. The
wire was removed and the inferior mesenteric artery was selectively cannulated
and a small contrast injection was made to confirm position. An inferior
mesenteric  arteriogram was performed.

Through the mickelsoncathter, a Renegade ___ microcatheter with a 0.018
Transend micro wire were used to select the superior rectal artery. 
Arteriogram of the superior rectal artery was performed demonstrating
prominent varix and early venous filling.  The guidewire was exchanged for a
0.018 GT-shape will glidewire.  The microcatheter was then advanced over the
wire distally to the superior rectal, lateral branch.  While trying to
advanced more distally, an arteriogram was performed which demonstrated a
small amount of spasm, therefore the catheter was then withdrawn. 
Subsequently 150 mcg of nitroglycerin was administered.  The subsequent
arteriogram demonstrating improved flow to the area and resolution of the
spasm.

Once appropriate position for embolization was confirmed, a contrast injection
was performed to determine volume of contrast needed for appropriate filling
of the abnormality.   Subsequently less than 1 cc of 100% alcohol was
injected.  A 4 mm x 8cm Concerto coil was then deployed.  Subsequent superior
rectal artery angiogram demonstrated appropriate hemostasis.  The cathter was
withdrawn to the superior rectal artery and repeat angiogram was performed. 
Then the micro cathter was removed and an ___ arteriogram was performed.

All arteriograms were medically essentially to evaluate feeding vasculature
and identification of the AVM with subsequent embolization.

The catheter was then removed over the wire at this juncture and the sheath
was removed. Manual pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.  Sterile
dressings were applied.   The patient tolerated the procedure well.

FINDINGS: 

1. Inferior mesenteric arteriogram patent without evidence of thrombus,
pseudoaneurysm, or dissection supplying superior rectal artery.

2.  Superior rectal arteriogram demonstrates an early filling vein (prior to
parachymal filling) suggesting AV malformation.

3.  Selection of superior rectal artery lateral branch demonstrated
appropriate selection of arteriovenous shunt for embolization.

4.  Arteriograms post alcohol sclerosing and coil embolization demonstrated

thromboembolic complication.

This procedure was performed by Dr. ___ & Dr. ___.  I, Dr.
___, was present throughout the procedure, supervised or performed
all key portions of the procedure, and have interpreted the relevant imaging
findings.

FINDINGS: 

Left vertebral artery: The distal left vertebral, basilar, bilateral superior
cerebellar, and bilateral supra posterior cerebral arteries are well
visualized.  Vessel caliber is smooth and tapering.  There is no evidence of
aneurysm or vascular malformation.  A prominent posterior meningeal branch of
the left vertebral artery is noted however there is no evidence of early
venous drainage to suggest pathologic fistula.  The remainder of the venous
phase is unremarkable.

Left thyrocervical trunk: The ascending cervical branch of the left
thyrocervical trunk is enlarged and tortuous.  At the distal aspect of this
vessel numerous fine and tortuous branches form a fistulous connection through
the occipital bone to the torcula and left transverse sinus.  There is
evidence of early venous drainage.  Additional small anastomotic branches from
the left ascending cervical artery faintly opacify the left vertebral artery.

Right internal maxillary artery: Major branches of the right internal
maxillary and superficial temporal vessels are well visualized.  There is
pathologic enlargement of the right middle meningeal artery with its posterior
division contributing numerous small fistulous connections to the right
transverse sinus.  An accessory meningeal artery is also demonstrated on this
injection which contributes additional feeders to this left transverse dural
arteriovenous fistula.

Right occipital artery: The right occipital artery is pathologically enlarged.
Innumerable branches from the occipital artery throughout its course pass to
the left transverse sinus with early venous drainage forming additional
feeding vessels to the left dural arteriovenous fistula.

Right vertebral artery: The distal right vertebral artery is well visualized
however the basilar and intracranial branches are poorly opacified on this
injection due to competitive flow from the left vertebral artery.  A
pathologically enlarged posterior meningeal branch of the left vertebral
artery forms numerous feeders which ascend and form a fistulous connection
with the right transverse sinus and torcula.  There is retrograde flow through
the superior sagittal sinus on this injection.

Left external carotid artery: Major branches of the left external carotid
artery including the internal maxillary, superficial temporal, middle
meningeal, and occipital arteries are well visualized.  There is pathologic
enlargement of the left occipital artery with innumerable dysplastic feeding
vessels to the torcula and transverse sinus forming a dural arteriovenous
fistula.  During the venous phase there is retrograde opacification of the
superior sagittal sinus.  Additional branches to this fistula are noted from
the accessory meningeal artery and posterior branch of the left middle
meningeal artery.

Right external carotid artery: Major branches of the right external carotid
system are well visualized and patent.  There is pathologic enlargement of the
right occipital artery with innumerable dysplastic feeding vessels to a left
transverse sinus dural arteriovenous fistula.  There is early opacification of
the transverse sigmoid sinuses with evidence of retrograde flow in the
superior sagittal sinus suggestive of a hyper pressure fistula.  Additional
feeders to this fistula are again noted from the posterior branch of the right
middle meningeal artery.

Right internal carotid artery: The distal right internal carotid, anterior
cerebral, and middle cerebral arteries are well visualized.  Vessel caliber is
smooth and tapering.  Reflux is noted into the right external carotid system
due to steal phenomena from a dural arteriovenous fistula.  The
meningohypophyseal trunk is pathologically enlarged with numerous tentorial
dural branches (among these, the artery ___ and ___ supplying
a right transverse sinus dural arteriovenous fistula.  Notably absent in this
injection is opacification of the dural venous sinuses suggestive of a
high-pressure venous system with limited venous outflow through the dural
venous system.  Venous drainage from the cerebrum appears to be through
emissary venous channels from the vein of Trolard and other cortical veins to
scalp vessels.

Left internal carotid artery: The distal left internal carotid, anterior
cerebral, middle cerebral arteries are well visualized.  Vessel caliber is
smooth and tapering.  There is a 360 degree turn in the mid cervical left
internal carotid artery.  The left meningohypophyseal trunk is pathologically
enlarged with a prominent marginal tentorial artery which gives feeders to the
left transverse sinus and torcula dural arteriovenous fistula.  Again notably
absent in this internal carotid injection are the dural venous sinuses due to
increased pressure in the dural venous from bilateral dural arteriovenous
fistulae.  Principal venous drainage from the cerebrum is through emissary
venous channels at the vertex which drain through scalp veins.

common femoral bifurcation.  There is no evidence of vessel injury or
dissection.  Vessel caliber is appropriate for Angio-Seal.","IMPRESSION:

epiphrenic nodularity is, likely prominent lymph nodes (2:9, 12, 13).  Nodular
densities in the bilateral breasts are noted and partially visualized (series
2, image 1).

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. 
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of intrahepatic
or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within normal limits. 
The gallbladder wall is slightly prominent, though not thickened, likely due
to surrounding ascites.  In the posterior aspect of the liver edge, there is a
a 2.9 x 1.5 cm hypodense deposit indenting the liver capsule (02:16). 
Anterior to the gallbladder, there is a enhancing nodule measuring 1.4 x 1.1
cm (02:29).

There is a small to moderate amount of simple appearing ascites in the
perihepatic and perisplenic region, tracking down the paracolic gutters
bilaterally, which is continuous with the moderate amount of pelvic fluid.

PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic
stranding.

SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without
evidence of focal lesions.

ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.

URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. 
Multiple hypodensities in the bilateral kidneys, the largest measuring up to
2.0 cm are seen.  The largest in the mid pole of the left kidney demonstrate
intermediate density.  Other subcentimeter hypodensities are too small to
characterize by CT.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.  There is no
perinephric abnormality.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  There is a moderate size hiatal hernia.  The stomach is
otherwise unremarkable.  Multiple mental nodular is are seen.  For example,
the greater omentum demonstrate increased vascularity and subcentimeter
enhancing nodules.  Enhancing nodules and masses are scattered throughout the
omentum, interdigitating between the bowel loops.  The largest deposit is seen
in the pelvic region, measuring up to 15.9 x 4.5 x 6.0 cm (601b:26, 2:55 and
62).  This large deposit appears to have a hypodensity, which represent a
cystic component (02:59).  Smaller deposits are seen throughout the omentum. 
For example, lateral to the greater curvature of the stomach, there is a small
enhancing nodule measuring up to 1.3 x 1.4 cm (02:28) and small enhancing
nodules in the mesenteries measuring to 1.5 cm (02:40, 48).  There is no
evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.

PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  The bladder
is decompressed.  There is a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:  In the pelvis, there is a heterogeneously enhancing,
irregular mass that is difficult to distinguish from normal adnexal structures
and the uterus.  Endometrial stripe is not appreciated.  A coarse
calcification is seen within the expected location of the uterus and within
the irregular pelvic deposit (2:70, 64).  Moreover, there is an exophytic
heterogeneous mass measuring up to 7.1 x 5.7 x 6.9 cm (2:59, 601b:43), which
is difficult to discern whether this represents a uterine or adnexal lesion.

FINDINGS: 

There is a large 6.1 x 4.1 x 5.8 cm extra-axial mass lesion (13:15, 11:40)
abutting the posterior left convexity which causes significant local mass
effect on the parenchyma of the left parietal and left occipital lobes.  This
mass is predominantly isointense to gray matter on T1 weighted imaging,
slightly hyperintense to gray matter on T2 weighted imaging, exhibits slowed
diffusion throughout, and heterogeneously enhances with evidence of a CSF
cleft and possible dural tail along its superior aspect (14:133).  There is
surrounding vasogenic edema in the left cerebral hemisphere with mass effect
on the parenchyma, as above, as well as complete effacement of the posterior
body and horn of the left lateral ventricle.  Additionally, there is
approximately 9 mm rightward midline shift and mild left subfalcine
herniation.  Effacement of the left ambient cistern may be positional or
suggest early left uncal herniation.  There is arterial blood supply to the
mass by distal branches of the left MCA with probable venous outflow from a
posterior left cortical vein (14:142).

There is no evidence of acute infarction outside the confines of the mass.  No
definite internal hemorrhage or calcification on susceptibility weighted
imaging.","IMPRESSION:

and thus the evaluation for subtle para-aortic abnormalities.

The imaged inferior thoracic and abdominal aorta is extensively tortuous and
ectatic demonstrating severe partially calcified atherosclerotic disease
throughout.  The largest focal region of aneurysm appears within the upper
abdomen proximal to the celiac axis, and measures approximately 5.5 cm in
diameter (601b:42), measuring 4.2 cm at this level on ___.  The
aneurysm is increased in diameter since ___ at the level of the previously
described contained rupture, where there is some mural hyperdensity which may
reflect intramural hematoma, not substantially changed since ___.

Multiple focal outpouchings of contrast likely represent penetrating
atheromatous.  The celiac axis and SMA contain dense calcifications, but
appear grossly patent.  Similarly, the bilateral common iliac, external iliac,
and right internal iliac arteries remain patent.  There is severe attenuation
of the left internal iliac artery secondary to atherosclerotic disease.

LOWER CHEST:  The heart is enlarged, with marked dilation of the right atrium.
There is a moderate left, small right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis, increased from previous exam.

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY: No concerning focal liver lesion although the liver appears
somewhat heterogeneous, possibly due to congestion.  Subcentimeter segment 6
hepatic hypodensity is stable.  Pneumobilia is unchanged from prior
examination.  Previous cholecystectomy.

PANCREAS: Pancreas divisum is noted.  There is increasing dilation of the main
pancreatic duct, now measuring up to 9 mm (5:60), previously measuring up to 6
mm.  No focal pancreatic lesion is identified on this nondedicated
examination.

SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without
evidence of focal lesions.

ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.

URINARY: The kidneys are small and atrophic bilaterally, and demonstrate
numerous bilateral renal cysts and evidence of cortical scarring.  There is no
hydronephrosis.

GASTROINTESTINAL: Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness
and enhancement throughout.  Colon is grossly within normal limits.  However,
the rectum is dilated and filled with stool with surrounding mural
hyperenhancement, which appears increased from the prior examination. Appendix
is not visualized.  There is no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of substantial retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.

PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There is no
evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid in the
pelvis.

BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. 
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 is unchanged.  Severe left hip
osteoarthritis, with small to moderate effusion.

SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.","IMPRESSION: 

1.  Fusiform aneurysmal, tortuous aorta with increasing focal aneurysmal
dilation involving the upper abdominal aortic, now measuring 5.5 cm,
previously 4.2 cm on ___.
2. There is no definitive, active arterial extension into the retroperitoneal
space, but the aneurysm diameter and area of left posterolateral outpouching
appears increased compared to ___ although similar to 1 day prior.  This is
compatible with an area of contained rupture/ evolving pseudoaneurysm.  Within
this area, there is some intramural hyperdensity which may represent a a
component of intramural hematoma, similar to 1 day prior.
3.  Extensive, severe atherosclerotic disease including severe stenosis of the
left internal iliac artery.
4.  Dilated rectum filled with stool with some mural hyperemia suggestive of
stercoral colitis.
5.  Cardiomegaly
6.  Small right, moderate left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis,
increased from prior.
7.  Pancreas divisum with increasing main pancreatic duct dilation, now
measuring up to 9 mm.

signal areas are seen in the mid to and on the left side which demonstrate
enhancement indicative of postoperative granulation tissue.  Within these area
there is 7 x 3 mm post gadolinium hypointense in area (08:29).  This could
represent postoperative change and a small amount of blood and soft tissues
given the recent surgery or could be due to a small recurrent disc herniation.
At the early stage in postoperative period, this is difficult to differentiate
and a follow-up examination and management based on clinical findings should
be considered.

Fluid collection within the soft subcutaneous fat and soft tissues (7:6)
appears to be due to postoperative fluid.  While there is no MRI appearance

NECK, THORACIC INLET, AXILLAE, CHEST WALL: Thyroid appears unremarkable. 
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

UPPER ABDOMEN: Large hiatal hernia appears significantly progressed from
prior, with the majority of the stomach located within the chest.

Calcified granulomas are noted throughout the liver and spleen, reflecting
granulomatous disease exposure.

A large, multi-septated cyst is noted within the upper pole of the left
kidney, measuring approximately 8.2 cm x 7.1 cm, similar to prior.  Septal
calcifications are noted.

A small cyst is noted in the upper pole the right kidney.

A 2.6 cm x 1.6 cm ovoid focus of soft tissue attenuation adjacent to the
visualized inferior tip of the liver appear slightly larger from prior.  Given
the similar density to the liver parenchyma, this may reflect a exophytic
projection of liver tissue.

MEDIASTINUM: Multiple minimally enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, measuring up
to 14 mm short axis at subcarinal station and 12 mm at right paratracheal are
similar to decreased in size from prior.

HILA: Calcified right hilar lymph nodes are unchanged, reflecting
granulomatous disease exposure.  Multiple nonenlarged left hilar lymph nodes
are also noted, measuring up to 8 mm short axis.  .

HEART and PERICARDIUM: Status post CABG as well as dense calcific
atherosclerosis of the native coronary arteries.  There is no pericardial
effusion.
PLEURA:  Trace bilateral pleural effusions, right greater left.

LUNG:

1. PARENCHYMA/AIRWAYS:  Improved bilateral lower lobe bronchiolitis, although
moderate to severe bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis is identified

lobes.  These appear mildly progressed from the prior study.  Multiple areas
of bronchial plugging are noted, particularly in the lower lobes, with regions
of endobronchial calcification in the right upper lobe (4, 78), reflecting
chronic infection.  Biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring, including right
apical calcified granuloma formation is seen.  There is peripheral scarring in
the right upper lobe.  Overall, findings are consistent with recurrent

Patient was brought into the angio suite, ID was confirmed via wrist band.The
patient was placed supine on fluoroscopy table and bilateral groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Time-out procedure was
performed per institutional guidelines. The location of the right mid femoral
head was located using anatomic and radiographic landmarks.  10 +10 cc of
subcutaneous lidocaine was infused into the tissue.  Micropuncture kit was
used to gain access to the right femoral artery, serial dilation was
undertaken until a long 6 ___ groin sheath connected to a continuous
heparinized saline flush could be inserted. ___ catheter was
connected to the power injector and also to a continuous heparinized saline
flush. This was advanced over the 0.038 glidewire brought up the aorta used to
select the right internal carotid artery under roadmap guidance.  AP, oblique
and lateral views of the anterior cerebral circulation were obtained .
The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and the right subclavian artery
was selected. AP and lateral road map imaging was undertaken.  Next, the right
vertebral artery was selected. AP and lateral views were taken from this
vessel for the posterior cerebral circulation.

Catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and used to select the left
internal carotid artery under roadmap guidance.  AP, oblique and lateral views
of the anterior cerebral circulation were obtained.



5000 units of heparin were given, and in collaboration with our colleagues in
anesthesia subsequent doses were given to target ACT ___.  Diagnostic
catheter was exchanged to 6 ___ Benchmark Delivery Catheter which was
mounted over an angled exchange length wire slowly and carefully with
continuous fluoro.  Then it was positioned at at a satisfactory position in
the left internal carotid artery, new road maps were taken.  Subsequently,
Marksman micro catheter was advanced on a synchro 2 wire until it was parked
in a satisfactory position in the middle cerebral artery (M2) carefully and
slowly under direct fluoro.

A new angio run was done at this point.  Measurements were obtained for the
pipeline, the synchro 2 wire was pulled out and the pipeline embolization
device was advanced until the tip was visualized at the M1 segment of the MCA,
the marksman and the device were then slowly Re treated into the internal
carotid artery an slow and careful deployment of the pipeline device was done
across the aneurysm, once we reached the satisfactory apposition against the
wall of the artery the pipeline device was completely deployed. A new angio
run was done at this point confirming patency of the internal carotid artery. 
The marksman Catheter was retrieved.  New magnified and de-magnified angio
runs were taken which confirmed the patency of the anterior circulation and
the excellent positioning of the pipeline device.

The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta fully removed from the body.  A
common femoral arteriogram was performed prior to use of a closure device,
subsequently Angio-Seal was put in. At the conclusion of the procedure, there
is no evidence of thromboembolic complication and the patient was at his

Relatively confluent areas of patchy enhancement within the left frontal lobe
subjacent to the resection cavity appear minimally increased in size from the
prior examination, and slightly more conspicuous, although these differences
are subtle.  A satellite focus of enhancement within the more superior left
paramedian frontal lobe (10:17) has increased in size and conspicuity.

The overall extent of surrounding, FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity which extends
across the corpus callosum and into the left gyrus rectus and sub insular
region appears overall similar.  No increasing mass effect.  There is no new
area for abnormal enhancement.

Areas of punctate high signal on DWI sequences within the central portion of
the enhancing lesion appear identical to the previous examination, without
definite correlate on ADC map.

Allowing for this, no evidence for acute infarction.  No acute intracranial
hemorrhage.  The background ventricles and sulci appear grossly prominent,
given the patient's age, compatible with global parenchymal volume loss. 
Scattered areas of subcortical and periventricular non confluent white matter
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity are nonspecific, but most commonly seen in setting of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

Small mucous retention cysts are seen in the right maxillary sinus.  The
middle ear cavities, and mastoid air cells are preserved.  The orbits are
preserved bilaterally.  A slightly right paramedian nasopharyngeal T2
hyperintense cyst likely represents a Tornwaldt cyst.","IMPRESSION:


1. Status post left frontal craniotomy and tumor resection with expected
postoperative changes.
2. Subtle suggested increased conspicuity and size of patchy enhancing lesions
within the left frontal lobe surrounding the resection cavity.  Although this
may be secondary to differences in technique, progression is not excluded on

intra-service time of 2 hours and 52 minutes during which the patient's
hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained
radiology nurse. 1% lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous
tissues overlying the access site.
MEDICATIONS:  As above
CONTRAST: 115 ml of Optiray contrast.
FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE:  39 min, 19 mGy

PROCEDURE:
1. Left upper extremity AV graft fistulagram.
2. Axillary, subclavian and super vena cava venography.
3. Chemical and mechanical thrombolysis of the thrombosed graft and outflow
vein using the Angiojet device.
4. Balloon angioplasty of the arterial anastomosis, intragraft, outflow vein
and central vein stenoses.
5. ___ balloon pull through of the arterial inflow.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient outlining the risks,
benefits and alternatives to the procedure. The patient was then brought to
the angiography suite and placed supine on the image table with the left upper
extremity abducted and stabilized.

Clinical examination demonstrated a palpable, but completely thrombosed graft
in the left upper extremity. Further evaluation by targeted ultrasound
demonstrated a completely thrombosed graft extending into the outflow vein.
The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
A preprocedure timeout and huddle was performed as per ___ protocol.
Using ultrasound and fluoroscopy, the arterial inflow and outflow stent levels
were identified and the skin was marked with a skin marker.  Antegrade
(directed towards the venous outflow) access into the thrombosed graft was
obtained under continuous ultrasound guidance using a 21G micropuncture
needle. Permanent ultrasound images were saved. An 0.018 wire was then
advanced easily into the outflow vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A 4.5F
micropuncture sheath was advanced and used to exchange for an 0.035 Glidewire.
The glide wire was advance to the level of the subclavian vein. A short 6
___ sheath was placed over the wire. A ___ Kumpe catheter was then advanced
over the wire and slowly withdrawn while injecting dilute contrast to
establish the distal extent of thrombus into the outflow vein.  Following, an
exchange length ___ wire was advanced via the Kumpe into the IVC for
stability.
Retrograde access directed towards the arterial inflow was then obtained in a
similar fashion using continuous ultrasound and intermittent fluoroscopic
guidance. Permanent ultrasound images were saved. Care was taken not to
advance the wire into the inflow brachial artery prior to thrombolysis.  At
this point ___ IU of heparin was administered systemically.
Tissue plasminogen activator was administered along the entire length of the
thrombosed graft and outflow vein using the AngioJet pulsespray device in the
both antegrade and retrograde directions. A total of 12 mg was infused. The
tPA was allowed to dwell for approximately 10 minutes. The AngioJet device was
then switched to thrombectomy mode and mechanical thrombectomy was performed
from the antegrade and retrograde approaches. An 0.035 glidewire was directed
into the inflow brachial artery and advanced proximally. A 5.5 ___ ___
balloon was advanced beyond the arterial anastomosis, partially inflated and
pullback was performed through the arterial anastomosis into the graft. 
However, there was a high grade stenosis at the arterial inflow, therefore the
balloon was nearly completely deflated prior to passing through the
anastomosis. This resulted in minimal restoration of flow and no thrill in the
graft. The antegrade sheath was then connected to a side arm heparinized
saline flush.
Subsequently, angioplasty was performed along the length of the graft and
outflow vein using a 6 and 7-mm balloon.
A fistulagram was performed from the proximal brachial artery demonstrating
brisk flow throughout the entire graft with severe stenosis at the arterial
inflow and venous outflow and additional site of stenosis centrally.  The
arterial inflow was plastied with 5mm balloon, however this was insufficient
to improve the inflow.  Therefore a 6mm balloon was used to improve the flow,
which resulted in satisfactory flow and thrill on palpation.  The venous
outflow was plastied with 8mm balloon with some improvement in flow.  There is
a small residual collateral.  Centrally a 10mm balloon was used with
significant improvement in flow.
Clinical examination revealed a satisfactory thrill along the length of the
graft.
The sheaths were removed and hemostasis was achieved with two 0-silk
pursestring sutures. There were no immediate complications.

FINDINGS:


1. Complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV graft to the level of
axilla.

PROCEDURE:  1.  Right internal jugular venous access using ultrasound.
2. Pre-procedure right atrial and superior mesenteric vein pressure
measurements.
3.  Contrast-enhanced portal venogram.
4.  Angioplasty of the native portal venous/superior mesenteric venous
junction up to 10 mm.
5.  Coronary vein (left gastric vein) embolization with multiple coils and
glue.
6.  Balloon angioplasty of the hepatic outflow of the TIPS up to 10 mm with
balloon sweep.
7.  Completion portal venogram.
8.  Postprocedure right atrial and superior mesenteric pressure measurements.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed
supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___
protocol. The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein
was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle.  Images of
ultrasound access were stored on PACS. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed
into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. A small incision was made
at the needle entry site. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.
The Nitinol wire was removed and a ___ wire was advanced distally into
the IVC.

The micropuncture sheath was then removed and a 10 ___ sheath was advanced
over the wire into the inferior vena cava. An Amplatz wire was advanced in the
sheath next to the ___ wire and passed into the IVC for stability. Using a 5
___ MPA catheter and the ___ wire, access was obtained in the right
hepatic vein.  The wire and catheter were used to traverse the TIPS into the
mesenteric venous system.

The superior mesenteric vein was accessed using a Kumpe catheter, Glidewire,
and Omni flush catheter through the collateral that connects the SMV to the
main portal vein.  Pressures were obtained within the right atrium and
superior mesenteric vein.  Venogram was performed, demonstrating good flow
through the TIPS.  There was difficulty accessing the native superior
mesenteric vein.  Multiple catheters were used, with numerous attempts to
access the vessel via antegrade and retrograde directions.  Ultimately, it was
accessed utilizing a Kumpe the catheter and roadrunner wire.  Venogram was
performed, demonstrating brisk flow through the TIPS.

Next, balloon angioplasty was performed of the native portal vein-___ 
vasculature junction, with 6 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm balloons.  There was good
radiographic results post angioplasty.

The coronary vein varix was then accessed.  The venogram demonstrated a very
large and tortuous vessel.  Using a 6 ___ RDC guiding catheter, Kumpe
catheter, and renegade ___ micro catheter, numerous coils were placed
within the varix.  Then, using a 1:1 ratio of n-BCA glue:Lipiodol, further
embolization was performed.  There was complete occlusion of flow noted
distally to the coils and glue on repeat venogram.

Subsequently, angioplasty of the hepatic outflow of the TIPS was performed
with the 10 mm balloon, with good result.  The balloon was partially deflated
in used to sweep the stent.  Repeat pressures of the right atrium and superior
mesenteric vein were obtained.  Completion venograms demonstrate satisfactory
flow through the mesenteric venous vasculature and TIPS.

The sheath was then removed from the right internal jugular vein site and
pressure held for 10 minutes to achieve hemostasis. Steri-strips and sterile
dressings were applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
post-procedure complications. The patient was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition.

the left vertebral artery.  The wire was advanced into the left vertebral
artery and the catheter was advanced over the wire.  The wire was withdrawn
and vessel patency was confirmed via hand injection.  Standard AP and lateral
views were obtained as well as 3D   rotational angiography.
 The purpose of the diagnostic angiograms was to provide baseline images for
comparison to runs later in the case to rule out thromboembolic complications
as well as understand collateral flow and rule out additional aneurysms. They
were also used for selection of devices as well as working angles. The
diagnostic portion informed the interventional portion that followed.
 Patient was loaded with 5000 units of IV heparin. Baseline and serial aCTs
were obtained and the patient was re-dose as necessary in order to maintain a
level above 200.
Roadmap angiography was performed of the left vertebral artery.  An exchange

intermediate catheter was flushed and connected to continuous heparinized
saline flush and advanced to the distal end the guide catheter.  An SL 10
loaded with a synchro 2 wire were advanced to the intermediate catheter. 
Under fluoroscopic guidance the microwire and catheter were advanced into the
basilar artery.  The intermediate catheter was advanced to the V2 3 junction. 
The microwire was withdrawn and the microcatheter was connected to continuous
heparinized saline flush.  Next a 4.5 mm x 30 mm Neuroform Atlas stent was
selected.  Stent was advanced into the Y adapter allowed to flush back.  The
stent was then advanced to the microcatheter to the distal end of the catheter
and deployed in equal distance proximal and distal to the aneurysm. 
Microcatheter was advanced over the deployment wire distal to the aneurysm and
the deployment wire was captured withdrawn.  The synchro 2 catheter was
reintroduced selected into the aneurysm.  The microcatheter was then advanced
into the aneurysm.  The microwire was withdrawn and the microcatheter was
again connected to continuous heparinized saline flush.  Next a 6 mm x 12.2 cm
Micrusframe coil was selected and deployed into the aneurysm.  This was
followed by a 3 mm x 6 cm target XL 360, a 3 mm x 9 cm target XL 360, and a 2
mm x 6 cm target XL 360.  All coils were deployed into the aneurysm without
any complications.  Following deployment of the final coil the microcatheter
was withdrawn under fluoroscopic guidance as well as intermediate catheter. 
Angiography was performed with working views demonstrating no evidence of
InStent stenosis or thromboembolic complications.  Final control angiography
was performed again demonstrating no evidence of thromboembolic complications
or InStent stenosis.
 Next the diagnostic catheter was removed.  The sheath was removed and the
arteriotomy was closed using a 6 ___ Perclose.  The patient was removed
from the fluoroscopy table and remained at his neurologic baseline without any

provider also monitored the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory parameters.

TECHNIQUE:
Patient was brought into the angio suite, ID was confirmed via wrist band.The
patient was placed supine on fluoroscopy table and bilateral groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Time-out procedure was
performed per institutional guidelines. The location of the right mid femoral
head was located using anatomic and radiographic landmarks.  10 +10 cc of
subcutaneous lidocaine was infused into the tissue.  Micropuncture kit was
used to gain access to the right femoral artery, serial dilation was
undertaken until a long 6 ___ groin sheath connected to a continuous
heparinized saline flush could be inserted. ___ catheter was
connected to the power injector and also to a continuous heparinized saline
flush. This was advanced over the 0.038 glidewire brought up the aorta used to
select the right internal carotid artery under roadmap guidance.  AP, oblique
and lateral views of the anterior cerebral circulation were obtained .
The catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and the left subclavian artery
was selected. AP and lateral road map imaging was undertaken.  Next, the left
vertebral artery was selected. AP and lateral views were taken from this
vessel for the posterior cerebral circulation.

Catheter was then pulled back in the aorta and used to select the left
internal carotid artery under roadmap guidance.  AP, oblique and lateral views
of the anterior cerebral circulation were obtained.  Subsequently, 3D
rotational images were performed requiring post processing on an independent
workstation under concurrent physician supervision and used in the
interpretation and reporting of the procedure.

In collaboration with our colleagues anesthesia, 5000 units of heparin were
given to target ACT between 250 and 300 subsequent doses were given as needed
to achieve this target.

Under constant fluoroscopy, using an angled Glidewire exchange, the diagnostic
catheter was exchanged to Benchmark catheter, which was advanced to
satisfactory position in the left internal carotid artery. The Glidewire was
removed, a new AP and lateral road maps were obtained, then DAC 038
intermediate Catheter was advanced over SL 10 micro catheter which was
advanced carefully and slowly over a synchro 2 wire until its was positioned
halfway into the aneurysm and the DAC in the cavernous segment of the ICA.

Please see separately dictated anesthesia documentation. The patient's
hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were monitored continuously throughout
the entirety of the case by a trained and independent observer.

TECHNIQUE:  Cerebral angiogram, middle meningeal artery embolization

COMPARISON:  None.

PROCEDURE:   The patient was identified and brought to the neuro radiology
suite.  She was transferred to the fluoroscopic table supine. After smooth
induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, bilateral groins were prepped
and draped in standard sterile fashion. A time-out was performed. The right
common femoral artery was identified using anatomic and radiographic
landmarks. The right common femoral artery was accessed using standard
micropuncture technique after infiltration of local anesthetic. A long 5
___ sheath was introduced, connected to continuous heparinized saline
flush, and secured.

Next a 5 ___ Berenstein 2 diagnostic catheter was introduced. It was
connected to continuous heparinized saline flush as well as the power
injector. It was advanced over 038 glidewire through the aorta into the aortic
arch. The wire was used to select left internal carotid artery. The catheter
was positioned over the wire into the left internal carotid artery. The wire
was removed. Vessel patency was confirmed via hand injection. Standard AP and
lateral views were obtained.

The catheter was withdrawn to the common carotid artery. A roadmap was
performed. The catheter was advanced in the left external carotid artery over
the wire using roadmap guidance. The wire was removed. Vessel patency was
confirmed via hand injection. Standard AP and lateral views were obtained.

The purpose of the diagnostic angiograms was to provide baseline images for
comparison to runs later in the case to rule out thromboembolic complications
as well as understand collateral flow and rule out any anastomosis between the
internal and external carotid artery circulation that would preclude
embolization. They were also used for selection of devices as well as working
angles. The diagnostic portion informed the interventional portion that
followed.

A smart mask was obtained from the previous run. Next an SL 10 microcatheter
loaded with a synchro 2 standard wire was introduced. It was advanced into the
left middle meningeal artery. The microwire was removed. Hand injection was
performed via the microcatheter to confirm positioning within the left middle
meningeal artery. Next 2.0  Cc of ___ embosphere gold particles next ___
with contrast were injected under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.
Embolization was concluded when there was sign of reflux and stasis of the
contrast and particles. Next 3  2 mm x 8 cm helical coils were placed at the
origin of the left middle meningeal artery. The coils were detached. The
microcatheter was removed. Follow-up angiogram was performed via the
diagnostic catheter in order to confirm satisfactory embolization of the
middle meningeal artery on the left. As well as to rule out additional embolic
material that was not intended. The catheter was withdrawn into the common
carotid artery. Standard AP and lateral views were obtained in order to rule
out thromboembolic complications.

Next the diagnostic catheter was removed. Right common femoral angiogram was
performed via hand injection through the sheath. The sheath was removed and
the arteriotomy was closed using a 6 ___ Angio-Seal.  After awakening from
general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was removed from the fluoroscopy

COMPARISON:  Left wrist radiographs of ___.

FINDINGS: 

Findings:

The study is mildly degraded by motion artifact.

Bone marrow: Marrow edema is present in the triquetrum and lunate, with cystic
change along the articular surfaces, which may be degenerative in nature
(04:14, 10:15). Osseous erosions cannot be excluded, particularly in the
triquetrum (for example 15:25). Nonspecific marrow edema is also present
within the volar aspect of capitate (4:7).

There is volar tilt of the lunate bone, with a capitolunate angle of
approximately 50 degrees (13:13).

Joint effusion:  Increased fluid signal within the joint capsule probably
reflects synovial thickening versus a small joint effusion, however this is
difficult to distinguish given the absence of intra-articular contrast.

Flexor tendons: Intact.

Extensor tendons: Intact, although there is dislocation of the extensor carpi
ulnaris tendon from the ulnar groove (04:21).

Muscles:  Muscles about the wrist within normal limits without edema or
atrophy.

Carpal tunnel: There is no abnormal bowing.  The median nerve has normal
signal and size.

___ canal: Within normal limits.

Triangular fibrocartilage and scapholunate ligament assessment is limited due
to motion, but appear grossly intact.  The dorsal band of the lunatotriquetral
ligament is indistinct, suspicious for tear (series 3, image 15).

Other: There is subcutaneous edema, particularly about the dorsum of the hand.","IMPRESSION:


1. Mildly limited examination due to patient motion.
2. Synovial thickening/fluid in the joint is consistent with synovitis. This

There is a 3 x 1.7 x 2.6 cm (AP by TV by SI) enhancing mass overlying the left
frontal lobe and extending along the dura with adjacent dural thickening and
homogeneous enhancement.  There is associated susceptibility artifact along
the mass, likely corresponding to calcifications seen on recent CT. There is a
focus of T1 hyperintensity adjacent to the anterior margin of the mass (series
3, image 13).  There is a focus of enhancement adjacent to the medial margin
of the mass, possibly surrounding the mass and related to hemorrhage or
raising concern for invasion of the frontal lobe parenchyma with corresponding
FLAIR signal hyperintensity (series 14, image 106).  There is extensive
regional FLAIR signal hyperintensity throughout the left frontal and parietal
lobes likely reflecting vasogenic edema with associated mass effect including
partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle and 6 mm rightward midline
shift at the level of the septum pellucidum.  There is no evidence of
infarction.  There are scattered superimposed foci of T2/FLAIR signal
hyperintensity within the subcortical and periventricular white matter.  The
ventricles and sulci are otherwise age appropriate in caliber and
configuration, allowing for mass effect from the lesion and associated white
matter edema pattern.

There are 2 regions of diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal; 1 in the
posterior left insula (series 6, image 15) and 1 in the right occipital lobe
(series 6, image 13).  They do not demonstrate associated enhancement but are
associated with subtle FLAIR and T2 abnormality (series 12, image ___ and 11),
which may represent acute infarct.

The major intracranial flow voids are preserved.  The dural venous sinuses
appear patent.  No suspicious osseous lesions.","IMPRESSION:


1. 3 x 1.7 x 2.6 cm enhancing possibly dural based mass along the left frontal
lobe with associated calcifications seen on recent CT, extensive regional
edema and similar mass effect including partial effacement of the left lateral
ventricle and 6 mm rightward midline shift given differences in technique.
2. Focus of T1 signal hyperintensity along the anterior margin of the mass may
represent a small amount of hemorrhage or calcification and focus of
ill-defined enhancement along the medial margin of the mass may be related to
a small amount of regional hemorrhage with involvement/invasion into the
frontal lobe parenchyma not excluded.
3. The most common differential considerations would include atypical
meningioma or hemangiopericytoma.
4. 2 small foci of diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal in the left

COMPARISON:  Prior CT head, dated ___.

FINDINGS: 

MRI BRAIN:
Punctate intraparenchymal cerebral foci of susceptibility on GRE likely
represent old microhemorrhages.  A T2 hyperintense lesion in the right centrum
semiovale with a rim of FLAIR hyperintensity and a similar T2 hyperintense
peripherally FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the left postcentral gyrus with
corresponding encephalomalacia on the prior CT are compatible with late
subacute infarcts.

A small amount of nonenhancing T1 intrinsically hyperintense signal, which
demonstrates extensive blooming on GRE is again noted along the anterior
aspect of the pons.  No evidence of aneurysm.

A punctate focus of enhancement in the left external capsule may represent a
small capillary telangiectasia (series 14, image 88) or developmental venous
anomaly.

Nonspecific enhancement in the deep white matter of the left temporal lobe
(series 14, image 60, series 1400, image 59) likely represents a vascular
malformation.  There is no corresponding abnormal signal on additional
sequences.

Additional subcortical, periventricular and deep white matter FLAIR
hyperintensities are nonspecific but likely represent sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.

The ventricles and sulci are normal in morphology.  The dural venous sinuses
are patent.

There is a moderate mucous retention cyst in the left sphenoid sinus and a
small mucous retention cyst in the left posterior ethmoid air cells.

FINDINGS: 

Study is severely degraded by motion and metallic fusion hardware artifact. 
Within these confines:

For the purposes of numbering, the lowest rib-bearing vertebral body with
descending to the T12 level.

The patient is status post lumbar fusion with laminectomy, intervertebral disc
spacers, and posterior spinal fusion hardware with extensive associated
artifact again noted.  There is redemonstration of known chronic compression
deformity of the L1 vertebral body, unchanged.  Multilevel Schmorl's nodes are
again noted.

There is interval decrease in the size of the previously seen large
subcutaneous T2 hyperintense fluid collection containing multiple septation
within the soft tissues overlying the lumbar spine measuring 11.3 x 2.0 x 4.3
cm, previously measuring 14.8 x 3.0 x 7.7 cm (4:10, 6:25).  There is also
interval decrease in the previously seen T2 hyperintense fluid collection
within the surgical bed surrounding the surgical hardware measuring 5.1 x 2.3
x 3.9 cm, previously measuring 7.7 x 2.4 x 5.1 cm (4:10, 6:32).  The
collection again extends anteriorly and inferiorly abutting the dura at the
level of L5-S1.  No new fluid collections are identified.

The visualized portion of the spinal cord is grossly preserved in signal and
caliber.  There is no definite evidence of lumbar nerve root enhancement.

There is redemonstration loss of intervertebral disc height and signal at
T12-L1 and L1-L2, unchanged.

From T12-L1 to L4-L5 there is no definite evidence of vertebral canal
narrowing.

At L5-S1 there is redemonstration of a nonspecific fluid collection with
minimal prevertebral extension, not significantly changed compared to prior
study (04:10).  Additionally, there is a peripherally enhancing, soft tissue
density along the posterior margin of L5-S1, which abuts the ventral thecal
sac causing moderate to severe vertebral canal narrowing at this level with
likely contact of the nerve roots posteriorly (8:9).  This is not
significantly changed compared to prior study.  With no vertebral canal and no
neural foraminal narrowing.

There is a moderate size loculated right pleural effusion. Signal abnormality
within the basilar right lower lobe could reflect atelectasis and/or
pneumonia.

There is a gastric fundal diverticulum (series 18, image 22).","IMPRESSION:


1.  Study is degraded by motion and by lumbar spinal fusion hardware artifact.
2. Cervical degenerative disc disease as detailed above, without high-grade
spinal canal narrowing or cord signal abnormality.  There is severe neural
foraminal narrowing at multiple levels.
3. Mild thoracic degenerative disc disease, without high-grade spinal canal or
neural foraminal narrowing.
4. Loculated right pleural effusion basilar right lower lobe could reflect
atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Chest CT is suggested.
5. Instrumented lumbar fusion at L4-S1, interbody fusion graft at L3-4 with
partial osseous fusion, and solid osseous fusion of the L2-3 level as detailed
above.
6. L1-2 disc extrusion with superior migration results in severe spinal canal
narrowing.  There is probable impingement of the traversing L2 and possibly
other nerve roots.  Allowing for difference technique, finding may be slightly
progressed compared to ___ prior exam.
7.  Within limits of study, no definite evidence of discitis-osteomyelitis, or
epidural abscess.
8. Probable subacute to chronic oblique fracture of the superior endplate of
L2 with lateral extension through the lateral vertebral body.
9. Right L1-2 and bilateral L2-3 Severe neural foraminal narrowing.",M,68
